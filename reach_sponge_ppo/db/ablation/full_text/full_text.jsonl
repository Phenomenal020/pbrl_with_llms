That means we must judge them based on how well the robot is making progress toward the sponge and how well it “mimics” expert behavior.\n\n a. Progress toward the goal:\n  • The sponge is located at approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. In Trajectory 1 the robot’s starting position is about [0.248, 0.0096, 1.122] and its final position is about [–0.363, 0.0095, 1.160]. When we check the displacement relative to the sponge, Trajectory 1 shows a clear movement along the direction from a positive x (farther from the sponge’s –x value) to a negative x as well as an increase in the z coordinate. When projecting the robot’s displacement onto the vector toward the sponge, we estimate roughly 0.20 m of progress.\n  • In Trajectory 2 the robot starts at about [–0.351, 0.0087, 1.298] and ends at about [–0.124, 0.0092, 1.294]. Although the start is somewhat “closer” in the x‐coordinate, the overall movement along the trajectory toward the sponge (when projecting along the direction from start to sponge) comes out to be only about 0.05 m. \n\n b. Following expert actions:\n  • Trajectory 1 has a complete expert action sequence (10 actions) available for comparison. Comparing step‐by‐step shows that some actions match (steps 3, 5, 6, and 7) while others differ. \n  • Trajectory 2’s expert “hint” is provided as a single action (0). With such limited expert data, the comparison is less instructive; however, even if we assume that the expert intended a “forward” action in that situation, Trajectory 2’s sequence shows several turns. \n\nSince the priorities are: (1) success/collision (both are equal here), (2) progress toward the sponge and following the expert (each equally important), and (3) truncation (not an issue here), we see that Trajectory 1 clearly exhibits much better progress toward the sponge even if its expert action alignment is mixed. In Trajectory 2 the overall progress is minimal, and the limited expert action data makes it difficult to argue for its alignment.\n\n2.

Its expert recommendation in that similar scenario was simply to “move forward” (action 0), yet the action sequence was dominated by turning (action 1 or 2) before eventually taking a forward‐move at the end.

The Euclidean distance to the sponge drops from roughly 1.14m to 1.06m (a small reduction of about 0.08m).\n• In Trajectory 2, the first observation is about (–1.139, 0.009, 1.021) and the final observation is about (–0.856, 0.010, 1.148). The distance to the sponge is reduced from roughly 1.67m to 1.41m (a reduction of roughly 0.26m).\n• Thus, relative to its starting position, Trajectory 2 shows greater forward progress toward the target.\n\nStep 3 – Comparing Robot Actions With Expert Actions:\n• In Trajectory 1, the expert actions are [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0] while the robot’s first six actions are [0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]. There are mismatches (action 3: 2 vs. 0; action 4: 2 vs. 1; action 5: 0 vs. 1), so about half the actions differ.\n• In Trajectory 2, the expert actions are [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and for the first ten steps, the robot actions are [2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2].

{"full_text": "Step 1. Evaluate success/collision:\n• In both trajectories, none of the steps ended the episode with success (i.e. reaching the sponge) or a collision. So on the foremost priority, both are equivalent.\n\nStep 2. Evaluate progress and expert action match:\n• Progress toward the sponge should be measured relative to the segment’s start. In Trajectory 1 the robot moved from (–1.1393, …, 1.0214) toward the sponge at (–0.109, …, 2.227) and ended at (–0.8556, …, 1.1479). Its displacement along the direction of the sponge is roughly 0.28 units.\n• In Trajectory 2 the robot started at (–0.344, …, 1.2403) and ended at (–0.3011, …, 1.3229), yielding a much smaller progress of about 0.09 units along the direction toward the sponge.\n\n• Now consider the expert action matching:\n– For Trajectory 1, the robot’s actions ([2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2]) compared to the expert ([2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) match in about 3 out of 10 steps (≈30%). \n– For Trajectory 2, using the first 6 actions (since the expert provided 6 actions) the robot’s actions ([0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]) match the expert ([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]) in 3 of the 6 steps (≈50%).\n\nSo, Trajectory 2 better follows the expert’s actions, but Trajectory 1 achieves considerably more progress.\n\nStep 3. Weighing the second priority:\nSince progress and matching expert actions are given equal weight, we can (in rough normalized terms) compare the two:\n• Normalizing by the best progress observed (0.28), Trajectory 1 gets a progress score of 1.0, while Trajectory 2 gets around 0.32.\n• Using the expert match ratios and normalizing by the best value (50%), Trajectory 1 scores about 0.6 and Trajectory 2 scores 1.0.\nAveraging these two scores gives Trajectory 1 an overall score of about (1.0 + 0.6)/2 = 0.8 and Trajectory 2 about (0.32 + 1.0)/2 ≈ 0.66. This indicates that the higher progress of Trajectory 1 outweighs its somewhat poorer expert action agreement.\n\nStep 4. Truncation:\nNeither trajectory is truncated, so no further penalty or benefit is added.\n\nFinal Conclusion:\nAlthough Trajectory 2 follows the expert action sequence more faithfully, Trajectory 1 shows a substantially larger progress towards the sponge.

Even though both starting and ending positions are far from the sponge’s y‐coordinate, the reduction in distance (mainly in the x and z directions) is roughly 0.35 in distance.\n – Trajectory 2 starts at approximately [–0.38, 0.01, –0.94] and ends at about [–0.44, 0.01, –0.62]. Compared to the sponge (notably with a z value near 2.23), the distance change is around 0.30.  \n\nSo in terms of relative progress (i.e. the reduction of distance from the starting position toward the sponge), Trajectory 1 shows a slightly larger net movement in the right direction.\n\n• Following the Expert’s Actions:\n – For Trajectory 1, the robot’s action sequence [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] is compared to Expert Actions 1 [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. There are more matches (approximately 4 or more similar actions) such that the motions are more in line with what an expert would execute.\n – For Trajectory 2, the action sequence [0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 1, 0] is compared to the first part of Expert Actions 2 [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …]. There are noticeably fewer matches (only about 2 steps match correctly).  \n\nThus, though both trajectories eventually resulted in a collision (which is highly undesirable), Trajectory 1 made slightly more progress towards the goal and its action choices are closer to the expert’s recommendations.\n\n2. Considering the priorities—with both trajectories sharing the collision outcome, the next factors (progress and expert action alignment) tip the scales in favor of Trajectory 1.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2671, "output_token_count": 2583}

In Trajectory 1, the net displacement from its start was very small and, when projected along the vector toward the sponge, it achieved roughly 30% of the required movement.

{"full_text": "Let's break down the analysis step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Check Goal‐Achievement (Success/Collision)\n\n• Both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 have reached an end-of-episode state.\n• In both cases the “collision” flag is 1 at the final step and “success” remains false.\n \n→ Priority 1 is “success or collision” – here both trajectories ended by colliding (i.e. neither reached the sponge). In that sense, neither “success” but the collision outcome is highly undesirable. However, because both share this, we look at the next priorities.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Evaluate Progress and Adherence to Expert Actions\n\nSince we are told not to consider one criterion in isolation, we now compare how the two did in making progress toward the sponge (and how well their chosen actions match expert “good” actions).\n\na) Relative Progress toward the Sponge\n\nThe target sponge is at about:\n  x = –0.109, y = 0.533, z = 2.227.\nLooking at the final observation of each segment:\n\n• Trajectory 1’s final observation is approximately:\n  x = –0.363, y ≈ 0.009, z ≈ –0.626.\n  Even if the full distance wasn’t computed step‐by‐step, comparing with the sponge shows that while the x coordinate is about 0.25m off, the z value is nearly 2.85m away from 2.227.\n\n• Trajectory 2’s final observation is approximately:\n  x = 0.622, y ≈ 0.009, z ≈ 1.976.\n  Here the z value is only about 0.25m away from 2.227 and though the x difference from –0.109 is about 0.73m, overall the robot in Trajectory 2 is much closer to the sponge – especially along the z-direction which seems key based on the numbers.\n\nRemember: progress should consider the change from the segment’s starting position relative to the sponge. In Trajectory 2 the robot moved significantly from a starting z around 1.95 to nearly 1.976 and, more importantly, ended much nearer in overall distance (≈0.93m error) compared to Trajectory 1 (≈2.9m error).\n\nb) Comparison with Expert Actions\n\nThe expert actions for each case are given:\n – In Trajectory 1, the sequence taken is [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] versus an expert sequence that is almost all “0” with a “1” inserted later. This means Trajectory 1 “deviates” from the expert on roughly 2 out of 10 steps.\n – In Trajectory 2, the sequence is [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] while the expert sequence here [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, …] shows there is a mismatch on about 3 out of 10 steps.\n\nThus for following expert actions, Trajectory 1 is slightly closer.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Weighing the Criteria\n\nThe overall priorities are:\n 1. Success/collision (both trajectories collided – so a tie here).\n 2. Progress toward the sponge and adherence to expert actions (both weighted equally).\n  • Trajectory 1 follows expert actions a bit better.\n  • Trajectory 2 makes significantly better progress toward the target (it ends much closer in overall distance to the sponge position).\n 3. Truncation (neither trajectory was truncated, so this does not come into play).\n\nBecause progress (i.e. how much the robot moved toward the sponge relative to its starting pose and ended much nearer to the sponge target) is as important as matching expert actions – and Trajectory 2 shows clear progress improvement – this makes Trajectory 2 the “better” option even though both ended in collision.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nFinal Conclusion\n\nThe highest priority (avoiding collisions/success) is tied between the two (both collided), but when looking at the next level of evaluation, Trajectory 2 makes far better progress toward the sponge while having only a slightly worse match to the expert actions. \n\nThus, if we must choose between them, Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal relative to the criteria provided.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2656, "output_token_count": 3344}

In Trajectory 1 the robot starts at about 1.08 m from the sponge and moves to roughly 1.05 m – a 0.027 m improvement (around 2.5% improvement relative to its start).

So at the highest level, neither finished the episode successfully nor ended disastrously by collision.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Compare progress (distance reduction relative to each segment’s starting point) and adherence to expert actions:\n\n• Progress: \n  – For Trajectory 1 the robot began at a position that was roughly 1.02 m away from the sponge (using a 3D Euclidean measure computed from the observation’s position and the sponge’s position) and then at one intermediate step the distance dipped slightly (to about 0.99 m), though by the last observation it was around 1.09 m. Thus there is some hint of forward movement (a dip in distance) even though it did not finish closer.\n  – For Trajectory 2 the starting distance was larger (about 1.27 m) and across the three observations the distance stayed essentially constant (around 1.27 m) implying that little or no progress toward the sponge was made during that segment.\n\n• Expert Actions:\n  – Trajectory 1 has an available sequence of expert actions. Although the robot’s actions ([2, 2, 0]) differ from the expert’s recommended ones (the expert sequence begins with action 1, then 0’s, etc.), there is at least an opportunity to compare. \n  – Trajectory 2 did not have expert actions provided, which prevents us from judging its alignment with expert guidance. Since we need to assign weight equally to progress and following expert actions, the fact that Trajectory 2 shows no progress is a negative, and we cannot confirm any additional beneficial alignment with expert recommendations.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3.

Trajectory 2, however, showed almost no movement toward the goal.\n• With the equal weight between progress and following the expert’s action (for Trajectory 1 there is at least a defined expert reference, even though the execution did not perfectly match) the progress difference becomes the deciding factor.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nConclusion:\n\nTrajectory 1 shows marginal improvement toward the sponge relative to its starting configuration while Trajectory 2 does not appear to progress toward the goal.

Compare actions versus expert guidance:\n• In Trajectory 1 an expert action sequence is available. The first action of Trajectory 1 (action 1 or “turn left”) matches the expert’s initial action.

For progress we must consider the movement relative to the start of the segment.\n• In Trajectory 1 the robot’s initial position is about [–0.656, 0.009, –1.073] and its final position is around [–0.638, 0.009, –1.060]. When we project the small displacement (approximately +0.018 in x and +0.013 in z) onto the vector from the starting point to the sponge, we get a very small positive progress (roughly 1.6 cm). This means the robot is, albeit very slowly, moving in the general direction of the sponge.\n• In Trajectory 2 the starting position is roughly [–1.856, 0.009, 2.129] and the final position is about [–1.926, 0.009, 2.175]. When we project the displacement onto the vector from start to sponge (which is approximately [1.747, 0.524, 0.098]), we obtain a negative projection (about –6.5 cm).

However, even if we were to compare the robot’s actions ([1, 1, 2]) with the expert sequence, the progress evaluation already shows that Trajectory 2 is regressing.

However, Trajectory 1 (despite starting farther away) makes a slight move towards the goal, whereas Trajectory 2’s motion actually results in a negative progress relative to the goal direction.

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step by step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Primary Criterion – Success versus Collision\n\n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 the episode terminated because of a collision (the collision arrays report 1 and 2 respectively, meaning a collision occurred in each case).  \n• Therefore, neither trajectory successfully reached the sponge, and both are highly undesirable on this most important metric.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Secondary Criterion – Progress (Moving Toward the Sponge) and Expert Imitation\n\nA. Progress  \n• The “progress” for these segments is measured by how much closer the robot got to the sponge relative to its own starting position.  \n• In Trajectory 1 the robot’s position moves from an initial point of approximately (–0.619, 0.009, –0.901) to a final point of (–0.627, 0.009, –0.619). When we compute the distance from these positions to the sponge (located at roughly [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]), we see that the final state is closer by about 0.27 m relative to the starting state. Thus, Trajectory 1 shows modest forward progress toward the sponge.  \n• In Trajectory 2 the initial state is about (–1.430, 0.009, –0.220) and the final state is (–1.051, 0.009, –0.207). When comparing distances, the robot’s distance from the sponge did not decrease—in fact, the computed distances indicate little to no progress (in fact a slight worsening).  \n\nB. Imitation of Expert Actions  \n• The expert action sequences expected in similar circumstances are provided.  \n• Trajectory 1’s action sequence is [1, 0, 0]. This means that the very first action (turn left) does not match the expert’s first action (which is 0, i.e. move forward), so Trajectory 1 deviates from the expert’s action pattern at the outset.  \n• Trajectory 2’s action sequence is [0, 0, 0], which exactly matches the beginning of its corresponding expert action sequence.  \n• Thus, on the expert-imitation front Trajectory 2 is in closer accord with the expert’s actions.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Weighing the Secondary Factors\n\nThe secondary criterion asks us to consider two factors – progress toward the goal and following expert actions – with equal weight.  \n\n• In Trajectory 1 the robot made forward progress (getting noticeably closer to the sponge) even though its first action deviated from the expert expectation.  \n• In Trajectory 2 the robot exactly followed the expert actions, but its movement did not result in any improvement toward the target.  \n\nSince the goal is to reach (and eventually grasp) the sponge, making progress toward it is fundamentally important. Even though both trajectories terminated due to collisions (failing the primary objective), between the two, Trajectory 1 shows an improvement in getting closer to the sponge while Trajectory 2 does not.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Third Criterion – Truncation\n\n• Neither trajectory was truncated (truncated = false for all steps).  \n• Therefore, truncation does not contribute any additional differences.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n\nEven though both trajectories ended in collisions (which is highly undesirable), when comparing the secondary factors the relative progress each made toward the sponge and their adherence to expert actions matters. Trajectory 1 made measurable progress toward the sponge, whereas Trajectory 2 did not advance toward the goal despite following the expert’s command sequence perfectly.\n\nIn balancing these equally weighted secondary metrics (progress and expert imitation), the forward progress provided by Trajectory 1 is a key factor in trying to eventually achieve the target. Therefore, Trajectory 1 is deemed as “better” in terms of overall goal achievement—even though both ultimately failed for the same critical primary reason.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 1489, "output_token_count": 3661}

Success/Collision Check  \n• In Trajectory 1 the episode ended (third step terminated) with collision value 2, and success is false.  \n• In Trajectory 2 the episode also ended (third step terminated) but with collision value 1, and success is false.  \nBoth trajectories did not reach the goal (sponge) and ended in a collision, which is the highest‐priority negative event.\n\nStep 2. Progress Toward the Sponge  \nSince neither trajectory succeeded, we compare how much progress they made relative to their starting positions.  \n• In Trajectory 1 the robot’s position changed from (approximately) [–1.43, 0.009, –0.22] to [–1.05, 0.009, –0.207]. When we consider the sponge position [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227], this segment shows little to no meaningful progress (in fact, the overall distance barely improves—in one measure it marginally increases).  \n• In Trajectory 2 the robot’s position changed from (approximately) [–0.619, 0.009, –0.901] to [–0.627, 0.009, –0.619]. Calculating the Euclidean distances (relative to the sponge) shows that the robot decreased its distance noticeably (from roughly 3.21 m to about 2.94 m). This indicates that Trajectory 2 made more progress toward the goal than Trajectory 1.\n\nStep 3. Comparison of Following Expert Actions  \nBoth trajectories are compared against a provided expert action sequence.  \n• Trajectory 1’s actions were [0, 0, 0] which exactly match the first three expert actions from Expert Actions 1 which start [0, 0, 0].  \n• Trajectory 2’s actions are [1, 0, 0]. Comparing with Expert Actions 2 (whose early steps are [0, 0, 0] for the first three steps), Trajectory 2 deviates in the first step.  \nThus, in terms of closely imitating expert action the first trajectory is more aligned.\n\nStep 4. Weighing the Priorities  \nThe highest priority is avoiding collision/success. Since both trajectories ended with a collision, we look at the next priorities equally:  \n• Progress: Trajectory 2 shows tangible progress toward the sponge, whereas Trajectory 1 does not improve (and might even worsen) the distance.  \n• Following expert actions: Trajectory 1 perfectly follows the expert sequence, while Trajectory 2 deviates in one action.  \nBetween these two factors, the progress metric is critical when both episodes are failures (collisions). Making progress toward the goal is very important in a care bathing scenario, even if the exact action difference is small.\n\nFinal Answer  \nBased on this analysis, while neither trajectory succeeds, Trajectory 2 shows better progress even though it deviates slightly from the expert’s action. Therefore, the overall motion trajectory in Trajectory 2 is of slightly better quality relative to achieving the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 1489, "output_token_count": 2776}

Even though the improvement is small, Trajectory 2 is at least not regressing.  \n\n• Comparing the robot’s actions to the expert actions:  \n  – For Trajectory 1, the action sequence is [1, 1, 1] while the expert sequence (the first three actions of Expert Actions 1) is [0, 0, 0]. All three actions differ from the expert’s.  \n  – For Trajectory 2, the action sequence is [1, 2, 2] and if we compare it to the first three expert actions (from Expert Actions 2, which are [1, 0, 0]), the first action matches while the second and third do not.  \nThus, Trajectory 2 is slightly better aligned with the expert’s take, and it shows small (albeit marginal) progress towards the sponge.\n\nStep 3. Truncation is not an issue here since neither trajectory is truncated.\n\nFinal evaluation:  \nEven though neither trajectory achieved complete success, Trajectory 2 is slightly better in terms of making progress towards the sponge and in following at least one expert action correctly.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 1469, "output_token_count": 2704}

The computed distances from the sponge show the robot has reduced its gap significantly – from about 1.88m down to roughly 0.92m.

Relative to the sponge position ([-0.109, 0.533, 2.227]), the robot reduced its distance by approximately 0.84 m.

Relative to the goal (sponge position with x ≈ –0.109 and z ≈ 2.227), the change in the z coordinate shows some improvement but the x value actually moves farther from the goal compared to the small initial x-difference.\n  – In Trajectory 2, the robot’s x coordinate moves steadily from about 1.555 to 0.622—thus closing a large gap towards the target x position of –0.109—and the z coordinate stays nearly constant with a very slight improvement. Overall, the Euclidean improvement implies a larger reduction in distance to the goal than in Trajectory 1.\n\n• Looking at expert action alignment:\n  – Trajectory 1’s action sequence is [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0] while the expert in a similar state mostly provides forward moves (action 0).

That being said, we then look at how far along they got toward the sponge and how much their actions agreed with an expert’s advice.\n\n• Progress toward the sponge must be measured relative to where the segment started. In Trajectory 1 the robot began about 1.14 m away (in Euclidean distance) from the sponge and ended roughly 0.83 m away—a relative improvement of about 27% (i.e. it closed roughly 0.31 m of the gap). In Trajectory 2 the robot started much farther (about 3.36 m away) and ended about 2.95 m away, a relative improvement of only about 12% (a gain of about 0.41 m). Thus—relative to where each segment started—the progress toward the goal was better in Trajectory 1.\n\n• Next, consider adherence to expert actions. Trajectory 1’s series of actions (0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1) agreed with the three-step expert action sequence ([0, 0, 0]) only in the first step (33% match), whereas Trajectory 2’s action sequence of six steps ([1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0]) compared against a longer expert sequence turned out to match in about four out of six steps (roughly 67% match). Thus, Trajectory 2 follows the expert’s recommended behavior much more closely.\n\nBoth progress and conformity to experts are equally weighted at the second priority level. While Trajectory 1 shows relatively better progress (about 27% progress vs. 12%), its expert action conformity is lower. Trajectory 2, in contrast, has better alignment with expert actions. When balancing these factors equally, Trajectory 2 edges ahead overall—even though both trajectories ultimately failed (collided).\n\n2. Based on the overall evaluation—with both segments colliding (the highest‐priority failure) but then comparing the progress (relative improvement) and expert agreement equally—Trajectory 2 appears to be “better” (i.e. it adheres to expert guidance far more, which boosts its overall quality even though neither reached the goal).\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 1905, "output_token_count": 2998}

However, where the expert suggests moving straight (action 0) on the third step, Trajectory 1 continues turning (actions “1”) and only later does a “2” appear.\n  • This yields roughly a ~66% alignment for the portions that can be reasonably compared.\n\n – For Trajectory 2:\n  • The robot’s sequence is [1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1].\n  • The expert-provided actions (“Expert Actions 2”) are [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\n  • Here, only the third action is a clear match (both are “2”), and one later action (the “0” at the fifth step) matches the expert’s “0”. Overall, the match is more off initially, leading to an approximate expert-action alignment nearer to 50%.\n\nSo, on following expert actions Trajectory 1 is closer, whereas on progress Trajectory 2 is stronger. Given that these two aspects are given equal weight, we must average the two.\n\nA rough normalized score:\n • Trajectory 1 – Progress: ~0.015 m vs Traj2’s 0.026 m (normalized ~0.58 relative to best) and Expert match ~66%.
