Trajectory 1 only pushes the sponge horizontally towards the torso goal but never lowers it into contact, so it never truly reaches or scrubs the torso. Trajectory 2 includes vertical motion that brings the sponge down onto the leg, effectively achieving the leg-scrubbing goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2551, "output_token_count": 990}
{"full_text": "1. The montage shows a yellow sponge and a mannequin lying on a bed. The top row shows the start (left) and end (right) positions of the sponge for trajectory 1, whose goal is to scrub the leg. The bottom row shows the start (left) and end (right) positions for trajectory 2, whose goal is to scrub the torso.\n\n2. In trajectory 1, the sponge remains at the side of the bed near the mannequin’s hips/torso region and does not descend or translate sufficiently to reach the leg area. In trajectory 2, the sponge translates toward and contacts the torso, better aligning with its goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2551, "output_token_count": 979}
