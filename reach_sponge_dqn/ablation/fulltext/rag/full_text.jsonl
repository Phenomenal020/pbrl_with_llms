Thus, Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal of progressing towards the sponge.\n\n2. **Progress**:\n   - Trajectory 1 shows negative progress, while Trajectory 2 shows positive progress.\n\n3. **Expert Actions**:\n   - There are no expert actions for Trajectory 1, while Trajectory 2 has an expert action of turning left (action 1). However, since the robot in Trajectory 2 did not follow the expert action, it may be penalized for not aligning with expert behavior.\n\n4. **Truncation**:\n   - Trajectory 1 is ongoing, while Trajectory 2 is truncated. Truncation is undesirable but does not directly affect the goal achievement as much as the progress does.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, Trajectory 2 is better in terms of achieving the goal, as it progresses closer to the sponge, despite being truncated. Trajectory 1 moves away from the goal and does not achieve any progress.\n\n**Final Answer: 2**", "input_token_count": 1649, "output_token_count": 559}
