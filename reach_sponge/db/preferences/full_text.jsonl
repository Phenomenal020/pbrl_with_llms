{"full_text": "Step 1: Both trajectories ended the episode with a collision (as seen in the collision array with a collision event on the final step and no \"success\"). Because collision is the most critical failure condition, neither trajectory achieved the goal. However, since our evaluation must follow all error/success criteria in order of priorities, we next assess secondary criteria—the progress made toward the sponge and the adherence to expert actions.\n\nLooking at progress relative to the starting position and toward the sponge (whose x‐coordinate is about –0.109):\n• In Trajectory 1, the robot started at about –1.325 in x and ended at about –0.103. That is a large improvement in the x coordinate, moving almost directly from one end toward the sponge’s x value.\n• In Trajectory 2, the robot started at about –0.427 and ended at –0.419 in x. This change is minimal; hence, its progress toward the area near the sponge is less significant.\n\nConsidering expert actions:\n• Expert Actions 1 is provided for Trajectory 1. The robot’s actions roughly include an early corrective turn (action 1) that is also present in the expert sequence. Even though the overall sequence isn’t a perfect match, having an expert action sequence available gives us some means to compare.\n• For Trajectory 2, no expert actions were given, limiting our ability to check if it followed a reasonable plan.\n   \nEven though both trajectories failed on the primary (collision) criterion, Trajectory 1 achieved better progress toward the goal and shows some semblance of alignment with the expert’s plan. In contrast, Trajectory 2 shows little progress.\n\nStep 2: Based on these considerations, the goal is comparatively better achieved (in terms of progress and expert action alignment) in Trajectory 1.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2628, "output_token_count": 2043}

Collision is the highest‐priority factor, so both trajectories are equally “failed” in that regard.\n\nStep 2 – Progress Toward the Goal:\n• To assess progress, we compare the robot’s change in distance to the sponge relative to where it started.\n – In Trajectory 1 the robot moves from about 3.30 m away (based on the initial observation) to about 2.91 m away from the sponge – an improvement of roughly 0.39 m.\n – In Trajectory 2 the robot moves from about 3.44 m away to about 2.90 m away – a progress of roughly 0.54 m.\nThus, Trajectory 2 makes more relative progress toward the sponge.\n\nStep 3 – Following Expert Actions:\n• The expert actions provided for Trajectory 2 (from a similar starting configuration) indicate the desired behavior. When comparing the first few steps, Trajectory 2’s actions ([0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0]) are quite similar to the expert’s actions (with only a couple of mismatches).

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step by step, following the three-level priority.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. FIRST Priority: Success/Collision\n\n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 the episode ended (terminated = true) but with a collision (collision value 1 at the final step) and with success = false. \n  → Thus, neither trajectory achieved success (no grasping) and both ended in a collision. \n  So at the top (most critical) level, they are equally bad.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. SECOND Priority: Progress Toward the Sponge and Following Expert Actions\n\nEven though both collided, we now compare how “good” the motion was based on progress and similarity to the expert’s actions. Note that progress is measured relative to the segment’s starting position (i.e. how much the robot moved in the direction of the goal).\n\nA. Progress Comparison\n\n• Trajectory 1 starts at approximately [0.04166, 0.00915,   –1.09595] and ends around [–0.18913, 0.00975, –0.61909].  \n  The vector from start to goal (with the sponge at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) shows that the movement made (roughly [–0.23, ~0, +0.48]) results in a dot‐product (i.e. projected progress) of about 1.62 when compared with the direction to the sponge. (A rough “progress ratio” is around 48% along the goal’s direction.)\n\n• Trajectory 2 starts at roughly [1.7106, 0.00926, 0.43275] and ends at [1.0398, 0.00939, 0.66852].  \n  When comparing the difference vector of the segment (about [–0.67, near 0, +0.24]) against the vector from its start to the sponge, the projected progress comes out a bit higher – roughly a 63% progress fraction.\n\nThus, while Trajectory 2 shows a slightly larger displacement toward the sponge relative to its own starting position, this is only one half of the secondary criteria.\n\nB. Following the Expert’s Actions\n\n• For Trajectory 1, the robot took 10 actions – all of them 0 (move forward). The expert’s sequence for a similar observation was nearly all 0s (nine out of the first ten were 0; the tenth expert action is 1).  \n  This means Trajectory 1 nearly exactly “imitates” the expert’s forward-moving strategy (9/10 match).\n\n• For Trajectory 2, the robot’s actions were [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0] while the expert actions for that situation were [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …].  \n  Although the three right turns (action 2) in Trajectory 2 may have an equivalent effect as one left turn (action 1) in terms of net orientation change, as discrete actions they do not numerically match the expert sequence.

{"full_text": "We start by noting that neither segment ended the episode with a collision nor a successful grasp; both are ongoing and not truncated. (Priority 1: success/collision – neither happened.) Therefore, we next look at the relative progress toward the goal and (if available) how well the robot’s actions match the expert’s (here, no expert actions are provided). One must not simply consider the absolute distance to the sponge, but the change from the starting position in each segment.\n\nLet’s break down the analysis step by step:\n\n1. For Trajectory 1 the initial observation (first 3 entries give the robot’s position) is roughly:\n  x ≈ 0.0417, y ≈ 0.0091, z ≈ 1.0729.\n  The sponge is at (approximately): x = –0.109, y = 0.533, z ≈ 2.227.\n  A rough Euclidean distance estimate from the starting point yields about 1.28 m. The final observation in Trajectory 1 is about:\n  x ≈ 0.2686, y ≈ 0.0092, z ≈ 1.0995.\n  That gives an estimated distance of about 1.30 m from the sponge.\n  Thus, relative to its very short segment, the robot’s position barely changed in a way that reduces the gap to the sponge (in fact, it increased marginally). That means little (if any) progress was made in this segment.\n\n2. For Trajectory 2 the robot starts with a position approximately:\n  x ≈ –1.7353, y ≈ 0.0095, z ≈ –1.5113.\n  Relative to the sponge position the initial distance comes out to roughly 4.11 m.\n  At the final observation the position is about:\n  x ≈ –1.0199, y ≈ 0.0087, z ≈ –1.4200.\n  This gives a distance of about 3.80 m from the sponge.\n  Thus, over the course of the segment, the robot in Trajectory 2 has reduced its distance by about 0.31 m relative to its own starting point—a non‐negligible improvement.\n\n3. Given that priority 1 (goal achieved via success or collision) is not met by either trajectory, and since no expert actions are available (so our expert matching term is neutral), the deciding factor becomes the progress toward the sponge based on the change from each segment’s initial position.\n\n4. Although Trajectory 1 starts closer in absolute terms (about 1.28 vs. 4.11) the evaluation calls for “progress relative to the starting point in the segment.” Trajectory 1 shows nearly no progress (in fact a slight increase in the distance), while Trajectory 2 shows a clear improvement. In other words, within its own context Trajectory 2 is moving closer to the sponge.\n\nBased on this analysis, Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2513, "output_token_count": 4111}

Thus neither trajectory has a “completed” episode. No truncation issues appear either.\n\n2. Progress (moving toward the sponge) and similarity to expert actions:\n • The sponge’s position is at approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. For each trajectory we compare the robot’s progress made relative to its starting point.\n  – Trajectory 1 begins at roughly [–1.785, 0.0097, 1.4740] and ends at roughly [–0.7475, 0.0089, 1.5171].

That initial distance is roughly 3.8 m. Its final observation in the segment shows a distance of about 3.66 m. The progress is minimal (~0.14 m improvement).\n• Trajectory 2 starts at (approximately) (–1.78, 0.0097, 1.474) with an initial distance to the sponge of about 1.91 m; its final position is roughly (–0.747, 0.009, 1.517), reducing the distance to about 1.09 m.

{"full_text": "Step 1: Analyzing both trajectories\n\n• Success/Collision – Both trajectories are still ongoing (none has ended successfully or collided), so we must look to progress and adherence to expert actions as the next criteria.\n\n• Progress – The sponge target is at approximately [-0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. For Trajectory 1, the starting position is roughly [-1.97, 0.009, 1.979] and the end position reaches around [-1.926, 0.009, 2.175]. This shows that—even though the absolute x‐position is still far from the target—the major “forward” metric (z coordinate) gets significantly closer to the sponge (error reduced from roughly 0.248m to about 0.052m). In contrast, Trajectory 2 starts near [-1.957, 0.009, -0.588] and stays around a similar position (ending near [-1.952, 0.009, -0.622]), meaning it does not progress from its initial location toward the sponge at all.\n\n• Following expert actions – The expert action in both cases is 0 (i.e. move forward). Trajectory 1’s action sequence ([1,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,1,2]) does not strictly mirror that; however, its resulting motion shows clear forward progress toward the sponge. Trajectory 2’s actions ([2,2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2]) do not include the forward move either, and given the robot’s stationary behavior in the forward (z) direction, it indicates it is not following the expert’s directive to move forward.\n\n• Truncation – Both are non‐truncated.\n\nStep 2: Final Evaluation  \nTrajectory 1 clearly makes progress toward reducing the distance to the sponge, whereas Trajectory 2 remains nearly stationary in the forward direction and even appears to diverge from the goal.

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step‐by‐step using the given three priority criteria.\n\n1. Success/Collision (most important):  \n • In Trajectory 1, the episode ended with terminated = true and a collision value of 1.  \n • In Trajectory 2, the episode similarly ended with terminated = true and a collision value of 2 (nonzero indicates a collision).  \n Since goal achievement means the robot must reach the sponge (i.e. success without collision), and both trajectories ended with a collision, neither trajectory succeeded. On the highest‐priority metric, they both are failures.\n\n2. Progress and Adherence to Expert Actions (secondary factors):  \n • Even though both trajectories ended in a collision, we look at how much progress they made toward the sponge relative to their starting positions, and if their actions roughly align with what the expert recommended.  \n • For progress, consider the first coordinate (assuming it is along the direction toward the sponge):  \n  – Trajectory 1 started at approximately –1.50 and ended around –1.05. That is about a 0.45 improvement toward the sponge (sponge x ≈ –0.109).  \n  – Trajectory 2 started much further away at roughly –1.96 and ended near –1.05, an improvement of roughly 0.91.  \n Trajectory 2 shows a significantly larger relative movement toward the goal.  \n • For following expert actions, note that the available expert demonstration for Trajectory 1 is long and mostly recommends moving forward (action 0), yet Trajectory 1 takes several turning actions (1’s and 2’s) that deviate from that. For Trajectory 2, although the expert actions provided are minimal (a single 0), many of its later actions are forward moves (several 0’s in a row) which are more in line with progressing directly toward the goal.  \n\n3. Truncation:  \n • Neither trajectory was truncated (truncated flags are false), so there is no difference on this criterion.\n\nSummary of Analysis:  \nBoth trajectories ultimately fail to achieve the goal because they each end in a collision (most devastating factor). However, if we consider secondary metrics, Trajectory 2 shows notably more progress toward the sponge relative to its starting point and comparatively follows a more “forward‐driving” pattern (closer to expert recommendation) than Trajectory 1.\n\nThus, while neither trajectory is successful in the absolute sense, Trajectory 2 is relatively “better” in its approach toward achieving the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2607, "output_token_count": 3614}
{"full_text": "Step 1. Outcome (Success/Collision): \n• Both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 end with a collision (collision value > 0 at termination and no success flagged). In that sense neither “succeeded” in reaching the sponge, and both are highly undesirable. \n\nStep 2. Progress & Adherence: \n• Looking at progress relative to the starting point toward the sponge, we compute an approximate improvement:  \n – For Trajectory 1, the robot’s Euclidean distance to the sponge (with position roughly [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) decreased from about 2.56 m at the start to around 1.96 m at the end – an improvement of roughly 0.60 m.  \n – For Trajectory 2, the distance decreased from about 2.91 m to around 2.67 m – an improvement of roughly 0.23 m.  \nThus, Trajectory 1 appears to have made more progress toward the target.  \n• Regarding following expert actions, the expert guidance for Trajectory 1 is just a single action [0] (suggesting “move forward”) while Trajectory 1 actually begins with a different action (2). Trajectory 2 begins with a “0,” which matches the expert’s suggestion initially; however, given that neither trajectory avoids collision and Trajectory 1 shows notably better progress toward the sponge, this factor is a tie‐breaker only if progress were otherwise equal.\n\nStep 3. Truncation does not come into play as both are completed (neither is truncated).\n\nOverall, although both trajectories result in collisions (the highest–priority undesirable outcome), the secondary criteria (progress toward the goal and action alignment) favor Trajectory 1 because it makes greater progress toward the sponge relative to its start.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2607, "output_token_count": 2498}

{"full_text": "Step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. Looking at the highest‐priority criterion (success vs. collision), we see that neither trajectory reached the sponge; both ended in a collision. (In Trajectory 1 the collision is reported at the final step (collision value = 1), and in Trajectory 2 the collision appears as a nonzero value (2) at termination.) This means both outcomes are highly undesirable, so we then compare the secondary criteria.\n\n2. For progress, we look at how much closer the robot got to the sponge relative to its starting position. In Trajectory 1 the robot started about 1.97 m away (using the x–y values) and ended about 1.0 m away from the sponge – a net improvement of roughly 0.97 m. In Trajectory 2 the robot started around 1.86 m away and ended about 1.31 m away – about a 0.55 m gain. Thus, Trajectory 1 makes more progress towards the goal than Trajectory 2.\n\n3. Next, comparing adherence to the expert actions: \n • In Trajectory 1 the executed actions (mostly ‘0’ meaning moves forward) are largely aligned with the expert’s sequence (which is predominantly 0 in its initial steps) with only a brief divergence.\n • In Trajectory 2, while the first two actions match the short expert sequence provided ([1,1,0]), the third action does not follow the expert (robot uses 2 instead of the expert’s 0) and subsequent actions further deviate.\nSo Trajectory 1 demonstrates a better alignment with the expert’s guidance.\n\n4. Although both trajectories ultimately result in a collision (a critical failure), when considering all criteria – progress and following expert actions (each given equal weight on the secondary level) – Trajectory 1 shows a better performance.\n\nThus, in answer to the questions:\n\n1.

Using the positions, Trajectory 1’s distance went from approximately 1.14 m initially to about 1.06 m at the end (a modest improvement).\n• For Trajectory 2, while its starting position was somewhat closer (≈0.89 m), by the end it appears to have moved farther away (≈0.93 m) from the sponge—that is, it regressed rather than progressed.\nThus, relative to its own starting point, Trajectory 1 shows positive progress toward the goal, whereas Trajectory 2 does not.\n\nStep 3 – Compare Following Expert Actions:\n• In Trajectory 1, the beginning actions [0, 0] are consistent with the expert’s sequence [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0].

For progress we must judge not only the absolute distance from the sponge but how much progress was made relative to the starting point in the segment.\n\n• Trajectory 1 starts around (–1.50, 0.009, 2.73) and ends near (–1.33, 0.009, 2.62).

Thus the top priority (success/collision) does not differentiate them. We then turn to the next two priorities: (a) how much progress they have made toward the sponge relative to their starting points and (b) how closely their actions follow the expert’s actions.\n\n• Progress toward the goal:\n – For Trajectory 1 the first observation’s position is about [1.49, …, 0.98] while the final is around [0.55, …, 1.06]. Using the sponge’s position (≈[–0.11, …, 2.23]), its initial distance from the sponge is roughly 2.0 units and it ends roughly 1.34 units away – an improvement (progress) of about 0.68.\n – For Trajectory 2 the initial position is about [–1.50, …, 2.73] and the final about [–1.33, …, 2.62]. With the sponge located at [–0.11, …, 2.23] the initial distance is about 1.48 units, and the final distance is near 1.29 – a progress of only roughly 0.19.\n  Thus relative to its own starting point, Trajectory 1 shows a larger improvement toward the goal.\n\n• Matching expert actions:\n – In Trajectory 1 the robot’s first few actions are [2,2,2,0,…] whereas the expert actions given are [0,1,1,0].

While neither trajectory follows the expert perfectly, both deviate from the suggested sequence. There is no clear win here, so this criterion is nearly even between the two.\n\n• Truncation penalty:\n – Neither trajectory is truncated.\n\nSince the top goal (success/collision) is not reached by either, and the expert action alignment is roughly comparable for both, the significant difference comes from progress toward the sponge.

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step‐by‐step.\n\n1. Neither trajectory has “succeeded” (reaching the sponge) or “collided” – both are unfinished and not truncated. That means we must evaluate their progress toward the sponge as well as how closely their actions match the expert’s actions.\n\n• Progress: \n – For Trajectory 1 the robot starts about 4.08 m (Euclidean estimate) from the sponge and ends around 3.79 m, a reduction of roughly 0.30 m (about 7% improvement relative to its starting distance). \n – For Trajectory 2 the robot starts much closer – about 1.39 m away – and ends roughly 1.28 m away, a reduction of about 0.11 m (roughly 7–8% improvement). In relative terms the improvement percentages are similar, but note that in absolute terms Trajectory 1 closes a larger gap.\n\n• Expert Actions Adherence:\n – In Trajectory 1, 10 actions were taken while the corresponding expert-provided sequence (Expert Actions 1) expects mainly “move forward” (action 0). Comparing the first 10 actions, Trajectory 1 has 4 out of 10 that match these expected values.\n – In Trajectory 2, only 3 expert actions were given (all “move forward”) and the robot’s first three actions ([2, 1, 2]) do not match any of the expert’s recommendations.\n\nSince success/collision is the highest priority (and both trajectories are equal on that) we fall to the second criteria – progress and following expert actions (with equal importance). Although the relative progress percentages are similar, Trajectory 1 both shows a larger absolute reduction in distance toward the goal and better alignment with the expert actions compared to Trajectory 2.\n\n2. Based on the combined analysis, Trajectory 1 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2566, "output_token_count": 3607}
{"full_text": "We start by looking at the three main factors in order:\n\n1. Success/Collision – In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 there is no reported collision and no indication that the goal (reaching the sponge area) was achieved. So neither trajectory “completed” the task yet, and they are equal on that highly critical level.\n\n2. Progress (and similarity to the expert’s actions) – Although the segments start at different locations, we must examine how far the robot has moved toward the sponge in each segment. Using the sponge’s position (approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]), we see that in Trajectory 1 the starting distance is about 1.39 m and the final distance is about 1.28 m – a net improvement of roughly 0.11 m. In Trajectory 2 the starting distance is about 4.09 m and the final distance is about 3.78 m – a net improvement of roughly 0.31 m. So although Trajectory 2 begins much farther away, relatively it makes more progress toward the sponge per its own starting point.\n\nLooking briefly at the expert actions: Trajectory 1’s expert action sequence is very short ([0, 0, 0]), suggesting that “move forward” is preferred. In Trajectory 1 the robot used several turns that diverge from simply moving forward. In Trajectory 2 the expert actions (a longer sequence mostly with “0” and a couple of turns late) are closer in form to the robot’s decisions (the robot carries out several “0” actions in a row as well). So taken together (progress and action alignment), Trajectory 2 appears to be doing a better job of moving in the right direction.\n\n3. Truncation – Neither segment was truncated; this does not contribute to a difference.\n\nStep by step, both trajectories are safe so far (no termination due to collision or success), but Trajectory 2 shows more progress toward the goal and a behavior that is somewhat more in line with the expert’s recommended actions.\n\nThus, overall, the goal is better achieved by Trajectory 2.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2566, "output_token_count": 2117}

In Trajectory 1 the robot moved from about (–1.1825, 0.0098, –0.9523) to (–0.3355, 0.0092, –0.6192), reducing its distance to the sponge (located at approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) by roughly 0.49 m.

{"full_text": "We start by noting that the highest‐priority goal is to either succeed or to avoid collision. In both trajectories the “collision” flag was triggered in the final step and the “success” flag remains false. (So at the top level, both trajectories failed to reach the sponge because they ended in collision.) \n\nHowever, since both failed on that highest‐level metric equally, we then consider the secondary metrics: (a) progress toward the sponge (where the measurement is relative to the starting point of that segment) and (b) how well the robot’s actions follow the expert’s suggestion.\n\nLooking at progress:\n• For Trajectory 1 the first observation is at approximately (–1.77, …, 2.42) and the final observation is around (–0.325, …, 2.41). Computing the Euclidean distance to the sponge position (which is roughly [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) shows that the starting distance was about 1.75m and by the end the robot was only about 0.60m from the target—a net gain of roughly 1.15m toward the sponge.\n• For Trajectory 2 the robot began at around (–1.182, …, –0.952) and ended at (–0.3355, …, –0.619). When similarly compared with the sponge location, its starting distance was around 3.40m while ending at about 2.90m, giving a progress improvement of only about 0.49m. (Also note that the z–coordinate of Trajectory 2 stays very far from that of the sponge.)\n\nNow considering expert action adherence:\n• In Trajectory 1 the robot’s 10 actions (from [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0]) are compared to the first 10 expert actions ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]). This results in mismatches on step 1 (robot turns right vs. expert move forward) and later on steps 8 and 9 (robot turns right then left vs. expert continuing straight). So it roughly gets 7 out of 10 actions that match.\n• In Trajectory 2, comparing the 10 robot actions ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]) to the first 10 of the expert actions for that scenario ([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), we see mismatches on step 1 and step 6 (only 8 out of 10 agree).\n\nThus, while Trajectory 2 slightly better matches the expert actions, Trajectory 1 shows significantly better progress toward the sponge. Since the secondary criteria (progress and action matching) are weighted equally, the larger improvement in progress in Trajectory 1 is a strong factor.\n\nEven though neither trajectory reached the goal (both ended with a collision), if we had to pick which one “better achieves the goal” (i.e. makes progress toward success and mostly follows the expert), Trajectory 1 stands out.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2677, "output_token_count": 3910}

{"full_text": "Step 1: Goal Achievement Analysis\n\n• Success/Collision: Neither trajectory reached the sponge (success = false everywhere) and neither experienced collisions or truncation. Thus, at the highest level, both are in “ongoing” episodes with no collisions or successful completions.\n\n• Progress Toward the Sponge: We compare how far the robot has moved toward the sponge relative to its own starting position. Using the position information:\n – In Trajectory 1, the robot’s starting position is roughly [0.2308, 0.0097, 1.1790] and its final position is about [0.1691, 0.0093, 1.1991]. The overall change is very modest, and when compared to the sponge’s position ([-0.1090, 0.5330, 2.2270]), the progress made (in terms of reducing the distance to the sponge) is minimal.\n – In Trajectory 2, the robot starts at about [1.7689, 0.0093, 0.9969] and ends near [0.1372, 0.0087, 1.0073]. This represents a large movement toward the target sponge (a reduction in distance by nearly 1 meter or so), which is significant progress relative to its starting point.\n\n• Following Expert Actions: \n – In Trajectory 1, the expert’s prescribed action sequence is [1, 1, 0] (implying significant turning maneuvers), but the executed actions were [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2]. This sequence does not align well with the expert guidance.\n – In Trajectory 2, the expert’s actions are [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (suggesting a straightforward “move forward” strategy) and the trajectory’s actions are mostly 0’s (with only a single deviation at the end). This shows good conformity with the expert strategy.\n\nStep 2: Final Comparison\n\nEven though both trajectories are ongoing without collision or termination, Trajectory 2 achieves far more progress toward the sponge and follows the expert’s recommended actions more closely. Therefore, Trajectory 2 is considered to better achieve the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2556, "output_token_count": 2422}

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the analysis step by step.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n1. Goal Achievement (Success/Collision)  \n• In both trajectories no success (i.e. reaching the sponge area) or collision occurred.  \n• Thus, the top‐priority criterion (avoid collision or achieve success) does not tip the scale in favor of either.  \n\n───────────────────────────── \n2. Progress Toward the Sponge  \nRemember that the “progress” metric should account for how much the robot’s distance to the sponge improved relative to its starting distance.  \n• Trajectory 1 starts at about (1.77, 0.01, 0.998) while the sponge is approximately (–0.11, 0.533, 2.227). The Euclidean distance at the start is roughly 2.31 m. The final position (0.58, 0.009, 1.01) is about 1.49 m from the sponge. So the reduction is about 0.82 m. Relative improvement is roughly 0.82/2.31 ≈ 35%.  \n• Trajectory 2 starts at about (–1.50, 0.009, –1.27) with an initial distance to the sponge of roughly 3.80 m. Its final position (–1.54, 0.009, 0.16) is about 2.57 m away, a reduction of around 1.23 m. However, since the robot started farther away, the relative improvement is about 1.23/3.80 ≈ 32%.  \nThus, even though the absolute improvement in Trajectory 2 is larger, when normalized by the starting distance, Trajectory 1 makes slightly better relative progress.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n3. Alignment with Expert Actions  \nBoth segments are compared against expert action sequences. The actions available are {0 = forward, 1 = turn left, 2 = turn right}.  \n• For Trajectory 1, the robot took the actions [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2]. The expert actions provided for a similar setup are [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. For the first 7 steps Trajectory 1 exactly matches the expert. Only at the 8th step there is a deviation (robot turns left when the expert preferred going straight).  \n• For Trajectory 2, the robot took the actions [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0]. The expert actions (when aligned to the length of the first 10 actions) are all 0’s. Thus Trajectory 2 has mismatches at steps 6 (action 2 instead of 0) and 7 (action 1 instead of 0).  \nIn percentage terms, Trajectory 1 shows about one mismatch in 8 (≈87.5% matching) while Trajectory 2 shows 2 mismatches in 10 (≈80% matching). Hence, Trajectory 1 is slightly more aligned with expert behavior overall.\n\n───────────────────────────── \n4. Truncation  \nNeither trajectory ended due to truncation.  \n\n───────────────────────────── \n5. Overall Comparison  \n• With no collision or success, we next balance progress and following expert actions (each equally weighted).  \n• Trajectory 1 shows roughly a 35% relative improvement with about 87.5% adherence to expert actions – averaging to around 0.61.  \n• Trajectory 2 shows around a 32% relative improvement with about 80% adherence – averaging to around 0.56.  \n\nThus, Trajectory 1 is slightly ahead in both relative progress (when normalized to starting distance) and following the expert actions. \n\n───────────────────────────── \nFinal Answer  \n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2643, "output_token_count": 3970}
{"full_text": "Step 1: Both trajectories are unfinished (no success and no collision), so we must compare their progress toward the sponge as well as their adherence to expert commands. Looking at the numbers:\n\n• Success/Collision – Neither trajectory registers a success nor a collision, so we move to progress and expert-action alignment.\n\n• Progress – For Trajectory 1 the robot started roughly at (–1.50, 0.009, –1.27) while the sponge is at approximately (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227). This puts its starting distance at about 3.80 m from the sponge. After 10 actions its final position is around (–1.538, 0.009, 0.156), which is about 2.57 m away—a reduction of roughly 1.23 m.\n  Trajectory 2 starts near (1.772, 0.010, 0.998) giving an initial distance of about 2.31 m. After 10 actions it is at approximately (0.582, 0.009, 1.010), about 1.49 m away—a reduction of roughly 0.82 m.\n  When looking at the percentage improvement relative to each starting position, Trajectory 1 improves by about 32% while Trajectory 2 improves by about 35%. More importantly, the final absolute distance from the sponge is lower in Trajectory 2 (≈1.49 m) than in Trajectory 1 (≈2.57 m). This indicates that Trajectory 2 is overall closer to the goal.\n\n• Expert Action Alignment – The expert sequence for Trajectory 1 suggests the robot should go forward (action 0) repeatedly. In Trajectory 1 the first five actions match (all 0’s) before a turn (actions 2 then 1) diverts from the ideal expert pattern. In Trajectory 2, the robot carries out forward moves for the first 7 actions (matching the expert for that segment) and only then uses turns. Although both show deviations later, the initial chunk in Trajectory 2 is slightly better in alignment, which coupled with its superior progress enhances its quality.\n\nAll considered (with success/collision being equal and a similar degree of minor expert divergence later), the better progress toward the sponge and generally improved expert adherence in Trajectory 2 suggest it better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2643, "output_token_count": 3331}

Progress Toward the Sponge  \n• The “sponge” is at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. In each trajectory we compare the starting and ending distances (using the first three numbers as the robot’s position).  \n• Trajectory 1 starts at about [0.438, 0.0093, 1.096] (≈1.36 m away from the sponge) and ends at about [0.189, 0.0096, 1.135] (≈1.25 m away).

When we project that displacement onto the vector from the start toward the sponge, we roughly estimate a progress of about 21% of the total required move. In Trajectory 2 the robot goes from about (0.438, 0.009, 1.096) to (0.189, 0.009, 1.135). When we similarly project that movement, Trajectory 2 makes roughly 13% progress.\n\nNext, regarding adherence to expert actions (which for both trajectories is the same expert sequence [0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,…]): Trajectory 1’s action sequence ([2,1,2,1,2,2,0,1,1,2]) only agrees with the expert choice in 1 out of 10 steps. Trajectory 2’s actions ([2,1,2,2,0,0,1,1,0,1]) match the expert in 3 out of 10 steps. Although Trajectory 1 makes somewhat better progress, Trajectory 2 follows the expert actions more closely. Because these two factors are given equal priority in the second tier and neither trajectory hit the goal or collided (thus leaving truncation and the highest‐priority indicator moot), when we average the normalized progress and expert adherence, Trajectory 1 scores roughly (21% progress + 10% compliance)/2 ≈ 15.5% while Trajectory 2 scores about (13% progress + 30% compliance)/2 ≈ 21.5%.\n\nStep 2. Based on the combined analysis, Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2607, "output_token_count": 3505}

Success/Collision:  \n • In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 the “success” flag is false at every step, and no collision occurred. So, neither trajectory has reached the sponge nor hit an obstacle.  \n\n2. Progress:  \n • We must evaluate “progress” relative to the starting position in each segment. The target (sponge) is at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227].  \n • Trajectory 1’s starting position is approximately [–1.286, 0.009, –1.493]. Its Euclidean distance to the target is nearly 3.94 m. Over the segment the final position is roughly [–0.761, 0.010, –1.606] (distance ~3.92 m), meaning the net improvement is marginal. Moreover, the axis changes (x moving in the right direction but z moving further away from 2.227) indicate the robot isn’t really progressing toward the sponge.  \n • Trajectory 2 starts at about [0.248, 0.009, 1.125].

Following Expert Actions:  \n • Both trajectories’ action sequences only partially align with the expert sequences. For Trajectory 1, the expert’s initial action was 1 (turn left) while the robot took 0 (move forward) first, and there are mismatches along the way. For Trajectory 2, even though the expert action sequence is different and short ([0, 1, 1, 0]), the robot’s actions diverge similarly by not matching perfectly.  \n • Since progress and following expert actions share equal weight (after success/collision), the nearly negligible progress of Trajectory 1 versus a more noticeable improvement in Trajectory 2 makes a difference even if neither exactly mimics the expert.\n\n4.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Check for termination events (success/collision):\n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 there is no reported success (no sponge reached) and no collision. This means we move on to evaluating progress and action similarity.\n\nStep 2. Evaluate progress toward the sponge:\n• The sponge position is approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. In Trajectory 1, the starting position (from the first observation) is roughly [1.467, 0.0097, 1.4647] and the final position is about [0.459, 0.0094, 1.6000]. Calculating the Euclidean distance to the sponge, the robot shows a significant decrease in distance (from roughly 1.83 m to almost 0.99 m) – a reduction of around 0.84 m.\n• In Trajectory 2, the starting position is approximately [0.619, 0.0090, 1.521] and the final one is roughly [0.582, 0.0094, 1.577]. The corresponding distances to the sponge change only slightly (from about 1.14 m to about 1.08 m), indicating very little forward progress.\n• Thus Trajectory 1 clearly outperforms Trajectory 2 in making progress toward the goal.\n\nStep 3. Compare robot actions with expert actions:\n• For Trajectory 1, the robot’s actions are [2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0] while the expert actions are given as [1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …]. Matching action-by-action (only the first 10 steps), there are 5 steps in which the robot’s action matches the expert’s instruction.\n• For Trajectory 2, the robot’s actions are [1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2] versus expert actions [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …]. Here, only 1 out of 10 steps aligns with the expert actions.\n• Therefore, Trajectory 1 also follows the expert’s intended behavior much more closely compared to Trajectory 2.\n\nStep 4. Consider truncation:\n• Neither trajectory was truncated, so this criterion does not affect the decision.\n\nFinal Assessment:\n• Since neither trajectory ended with success nor collision, we depend on progress and expert alignment (which both are equally weighted). Trajectory 1 shows significant progress toward the sponge and a much better alignment with expert actions, whereas Trajectory 2 barely makes progress and follows the expert actions poorly.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2629, "output_token_count": 2410}

Computing the Euclidean distance from the starting (≈0.2425, 0.0086) to the sponge (≈–0.109, 0.533) gives about 0.63 m. At the end the distance is about 0.52 m – roughly a 0.11 m improvement.\n • For Trajectory 2 the robot started at about (0.0058, 0.0090) and ended around (–0.0073, 0.0095). Although its initial distance from the target (≈–0.109, 0.533) was around 0.54 m, the final distance remains about 0.53 m – an improvement of only about 0.003 m.\nSo by progress alone, Trajectory 1 shows noticeably more movement toward the sponge.\n\nStep 2. Alignment with Expert Actions:\n • Expert Actions for Trajectory 1 are given as [0, 1, 1, 0, 0] while the robot’s first five actual actions are [1, 2, 2, 0, 1]. Only one out of five roughly matches the expert guidance.\n • Expert Actions for Trajectory 2 are [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] and comparing (roughly) the first several actions in Trajectory 2 [2, 2, 0, 0, 1, …] we see that many actions match the expert (for example, the first, third, and fourth steps as well as a couple later on).\nThus for following expert guidance Trajectory 2 shows a substantially better match.\n\nStep 3. Balancing the Two:\nThe design specifies that progress toward the sponge and following expert actions are equally weighted. Although Trajectory 1 shows better progress (about a 17% improvement relative to its starting gap) Trajectory 2 shows almost no progress (under 1%) but has much closer adherence to the expert actions (about 55–60% match vs. roughly 20% for Trajectory 1). When these two components are given equal weight, the strong expert alignment in Trajectory 2 outweighs the moderate progress advantage of Trajectory 1.\n\nSince neither trajectory succeeded (nor did either have collisions or truncation concerns), and based on the combined (equally weighted) secondary criteria, it is judged that Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2566, "output_token_count": 4973}
{"full_text": "Step 1. Check success/collision status:\n• Both trajectories have no collision and neither has reached the sponge (success = false).\n• So neither terminates with success nor collision; we proceed to evaluate progress and similarity to the expert.\n\nStep 2. Evaluate progress toward the sponge:\n• The sponge is at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. For each segment we compare the starting and ending distances (and note the relative improvement).\n• In Trajectory 1 the robot’s position changes from about [0.0058, 0.0090, 1.0277] to [–0.0072, 0.0095, 1.1623]. The Euclidean distance to the sponge decreases from roughly 1.314 m to about 1.191 m. This is roughly a 9% improvement relative to its starting distance.\n• In Trajectory 2 the robot moves from approximately [0.2425, 0.0086, –1.5633] to [–0.0811, 0.0095, –1.4336]. Although the raw reduction in distance is similar (about 0.144 m decrease), relative to its large initial gap (around 3.84 m), this improvement is only about 4%.\n• Hence, Trajectory 1 shows better progress toward the sponge.\n\nStep 3. Compare the actions taken with the expert actions:\n• Expert Actions 1 for Trajectory 1 are [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Comparing with Trajectory 1’s actions [2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2] shows several matches (at steps 1, 3, 4, 7, 8), roughly a 55% (5 out of 9 compared) match.\n• Expert Actions 2 for Trajectory 2 are [0, 1, 1, 0, 0], but Trajectory 2’s actions [1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2] match only at step 4 out of 5 steps (~20%).\n• Thus, Trajectory 1 adheres more closely to the expert’s actions.\n\nStep 4. Final Analysis:\n• Neither trajectory has reached the goal or collided, so we use progress and expert alignment as our next criteria.\n• Trajectory 1 shows a greater relative progress toward the sponge and its actions more closely follow the expert guidance.\n• Although the raw forward distance improvement in Trajectory 2 is slightly larger, its sheer starting distance and poor expert guidance adherence make it less effective.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2566, "output_token_count": 2773}

Goal Achievement Evaluation\n\n• Success/Collision Criterion: In both Trajectories 1 and 2, no collision or success is registered, so we must look at progress and expert action matching.\n\nStep 2.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Check for Success or Collision:\n• Neither Trajectory 1 nor Trajectory 2 ends the episode with a “success” (reaching the sponge) or a “collision.” Both remain ongoing (no termination nor truncation).\n\nStep 2. Evaluate Progress and Consistency with Expert Actions:\n• Trajectory 1:\n  – The robot’s starting positions are around (x = –1.514, y ≈ 0.0306). The sponge is at approximately (x = –0.109, y = 0.533).\n  – The distance from the start to the sponge is roughly 1.5 m, but the recorded positions barely change over the segment – the x and y coordinates remain almost constant. In addition, the actions are dominated by turning (actions 2 and 1) with only two forward moves which would move it by 0.2m each. \n  – The expert’s recommended actions begin with a forward move (action 0) but the robot starts with turns. Thus, there’s little progress toward the sponge and the expert plan is not closely followed.\n\n• Trajectory 2:\n  – The starting positions are around (x ≈ 1.7535, y ≈ 0.0094). The sponge’s location at (x ≈ –0.109, y ≈ 0.533) is farther away initially – roughly 1.9 m away.\n  – Over the segment, the robot’s x coordinate moves substantially from about 1.7535 down to roughly 0.4978, indicating a clear movement toward the sponge along the x-axis. Although the y coordinate stays low, the relative motion shows progress, reducing the remaining distance from roughly 1.935 m initially to about 0.8 m by the end of the segment.\n  – The expert’s recommended actions for Trajectory 2 prescribe starting with a turn (action 2) followed by forward moves (action 0), which is in close correspondence with the observed actions. This suggests the robot is acting in a manner more aligned with expert behavior.\n\nStep 3. Consideration of Truncation:\n• Neither trajectory is truncated, so this criterion does not influence the evaluation.\n\nConclusion:\nWhile neither trajectory has completed the task successfully, Trajectory 2 shows evident progress in moving toward the sponge and follows an action pattern that is more consistent with the expert’s guidance. Trajectory 1, by contrast, shows almost no progress.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2583, "output_token_count": 1926}

{"full_text": "Step 1. Checking episode completion:\n• Both trajectories are ongoing: neither shows a “success” (i.e. reaching the sponge) or a “collision” and neither is truncated. Thus, at the top‐level “success/collision” priority, they are on equal footing.\n\nStep 2. Evaluating progress:\n• The “progress” measure should be computed relative to each segment’s starting distance to the target sponge. For Trajectory 1 the robot starts at about (–1.47, 0.01, 0.97); the sponge is at about (–0.11, 0.53, 2.23), giving an initial distance of roughly 1.93 m. Its final position in the segment is roughly (–1.28, 0.009, 1.24) – a reduction of about 0.31 m in the overall gap.\n• For Trajectory 2 the starting position is about (1.73, 0.009, –1.52) with an initial distance around 4.21 m; the final observation (roughly (1.28, 0.01, –1.53)) shows an improvement of only about 0.17 m toward the sponge.\n• Therefore, in terms of progress toward the goal relative to their respective starting positions, Trajectory 1 makes significantly more relative head‐way.\n\nStep 3. Evaluating conformity with expert actions:\n• For Trajectory 1 the sequence of taken actions is [2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0] while the expert’s suggested actions (when considering the first 10 moves) are [0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Comparing step‐by‐step, only the final step (0 vs 0) is an exact match – about 10% alignment.\n• For Trajectory 2 the robot’s actions are [1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1] and the expert’s first 10 actions are [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Here the first action (1) matches and there are two more matches (at steps 8 and 9, 0 vs 0) – roughly 30% overall. Thus, Trajectory 2 better follows the expert’s action guidance.\n\nStep 4. Combining the criteria (with progress and expert action alignment weighted equally):\n• Relative progress: Trajectory 1 shows about a 16% improvement relative to its starting gap versus roughly 4% for Trajectory 2.\n• Expert alignment: Trajectory 1 is about 10% aligned versus 30% for Trajectory 2.\n• Averaging these (roughly (16%+10%)/2 ≈ 13% for Trajectory 1 compared with (4%+30%)/2 ≈ 17% for Trajectory 2) suggests that despite Trajectory 1’s better “progress” the stronger alignment with expert actions in Trajectory 2 gives it a slight edge overall.\n\nStep 5.

{"full_text": "We can break down the evaluation as follows:\n\n1. Neither segment ended successfully nor suffered a collision, and neither was truncated. That means at the highest priority both are “safe” and both were “ongoing” without a definitive goal result. So we must move to the next priority: progress toward the sponge and adherence to expert actions.\n\n• Progress: For each segment we first consider how much the robot has moved \"toward\" the sponge relative to its own starting point. In Trajectory 1 (whose first position was about (–1.73, …, –1.01) and final position about (–0.93, …, –1.00)) the robot reduced its distance to the sponge (located at roughly (–0.11, 0.53, 2.23)) by about 0.28 m. In Trajectory 2 (starting at roughly (1.97, …, 1.54) and finishing near (1.64, …, 1.47)) the robot made a similar reduction (approximately 0.28 m) but given its closer starting distance this represents a larger fraction of the gap. In other words, relative to where it started, Trajectory 2 made somewhat higher proportional progress. \n\n• Expert actions: We compare the robot’s chosen discrete actions to expert suggestions. In Trajectory 1 the 10 actions had about three matches with the expert’s recommended sequence (when aligning the early steps), while Trajectory 2 showed only about two matches over its 10 actions. \n\nSince the policy is to combine progress and expert adherence with equal importance, we have a slight trade–Trajectory 2 makes a relatively larger proportional progress toward the sponge, whereas Trajectory 1 better follows the expert actions. When weighing these equally, the evidence is that Trajectory 1’s overall plan better mimics the expert guidance even though its relative progress is a little less; both factors are crucial for ultimately grasping the sponge.\n\n2.

{"full_text": "Step 1: Both trajectories are unfinished (no success, collision, or truncation), so we must compare how well they make progress toward the sponge and how closely they mimic expert actions. Looking at progress, we note that the goal sponge position in both cases is far from the respective starting positions. In Trajectory 1 the robot’s positions (starting around [–0.4973, 0.0090, –1.3372] to ending about [–0.4000, 0.0094, –1.2496]) show a slight movement in the direction that, when compared to the vector from the starting point to the sponge ([–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]), is in the correct (positive) direction. In contrast, Trajectory 2 (starting around [0.4979, 0.0092, 1.0945] to ending about [0.6430, 0.0095, 0.9907]) actually moved in a direction that is opposite to that required to reach the sponge (for example, it increased its x value while the goal’s x is lower than the start, and its z decreased even though the sponge’s z lies higher).\n\nStep 2: Regarding following expert actions, the expert command for Trajectory 1 was [1, 0] while the actual action sequence deviated (starting with a “turn right” rather than a “turn left”), yet the critical factor is progress—and Trajectory 1 at least made movement in the proper direction. For Trajectory 2, the expert recommended plain “move forward” actions ([0, 0, 0]), but the robot’s actions (starting with a turn and then different turns) do not seem to align with that, resulting in movement that actually goes away from the sponge.\n\nGiven the priorities (first success/collision which are equal, and then progress and action alignment), Trajectory 1 shows better progress—even if the expert actions are imperfect, its movement is more in line with moving toward the sponge.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2532, "output_token_count": 2675}
{"full_text": "Step 1. Check for success or collision:\n • Both trajectories report no collision and no “success” (the robot hasn’t reached the sponge) so neither has achieved the goal outright.\n\nStep 2. Evaluate progress:\n • Remember that progress is measured relative to the starting position of the segment in moving toward the sponge at (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227). \n • In Trajectory 1 the robot starts at approximately (0.498, 0.009, 1.095) and ends at (0.643, 0.009, 0.991). When comparing the Euclidean distances from these points to the sponge, the distance slightly increases (roughly from 1.39 m to 1.54 m), meaning it has moved away rather than closer.\n • In Trajectory 2 the robot starts at about (–0.497, 0.009, –1.337) and finishes at (–0.400, 0.009, –1.250). Here the distance to the sponge decreases slightly (from roughly 3.63 m to 3.53 m). Despite being farther overall, the robot in Trajectory 2 makes modest improvement relative to its own starting point.\n\nStep 3. Assess alignment with expert actions:\n • The expert actions for Trajectory 1 are [0, 0, 0] (suggesting a straightforward forward motion) while Trajectory 1’s actions are [2, 0, 1, …]. Only one out of the first three actions matches the expert pattern.\n • For Trajectory 2 the expert actions are [1, 0]. Its first two actions are [2, 0] where one matches the expert’s second action. In both cases the overall alignment isn’t perfect, but since the progress is weighted equally with action alignment and success/collision is the top priority, the improvement in progress in Trajectory 2 is a key factor.\n\nStep 4. Truncation is not an issue for either.\n\nConclusion: Since neither achieved the goal outright, the evaluation boils down to comparing progress relative to the starting position and following the expert’s indications. Trajectory 1 appears to slightly worsen its closeness to the sponge, while Trajectory 2 makes a small but definite move in the right direction.

For Trajectory 1 the distance from the robot’s positions to the sponge shows a (small) improvement (the final position is slightly closer than the starting position).

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step‐by‐step.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1. Check Success/Collision  \n• In each segment the episode ended because of a collision (the final “collision” value is 1 in both cases, and “success” is false).  \n• Since success (reaching the sponge) is the top priority and both trajectories ended with a collision, neither “succeeded.”  \n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2. Look at Progress (and Relative “Distance Improvement”)  \nSince the trajectories start at very different locations, we look at how much closer they get to the sponge relative to where they started. The sponge is at \n  [-0.109, 0.533, 2.227].\n\n• Trajectory 1 starts at ≈[1.96, 0.01, –0.94] and ends at ≈[1.125, 0.012, –0.796].  \n  – Its initial Euclidean distance to the sponge is roughly 3.82 m and it ends about 3.31 m away—a reduction of about 0.51 m.  \n  – In absolute terms, it is still far from the sponge.\n\n• Trajectory 2 starts at ≈[–0.522, 0.0091, 1.6597] and ends at ≈[–0.351, 0.0095, 1.7547].  \n  – Its initial distance is around 0.88 m and it ends roughly 0.75 m away—a reduction of about 0.13 m.  \n  – More importantly, at the end it is very near the sponge compared to Trajectory 1.\n\nAlthough Trajectory 2’s improvement (0.13 m) is smaller in absolute change than Trajectory 1’s (0.51 m), note that Trajectory 2 starts very close to the goal and finishes even closer—so its final configuration is much nearer the sponge.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Compare Expert Action Trends  \nWe have expert actions given “in a similar starting position.”  \n• For Trajectory 1 the expert suggestion is [1, 1, 0] and the robot’s first two actions match these before diverging at the third step.  \n• For Trajectory 2 the expert sequence is mostly zeros with a leading action 2, while the robot’s actions differ on most steps (only about 3 out of 10 steps match).  \nThus, Trajectory 1 follows the expert’s intended maneuvers more closely, whereas Trajectory 2 deviates more from the expert pattern. \n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Synthesize With Priorities  \nThe priorities are:  \n1. Success/collision  \n  • Both trajectories ended with a collision (a highly undesirable outcome).  \n2. Progress and execution of expert-like actions (equal weight)  \n  • Trajectory 1: Has a “better” match to the expert’s suggested maneuver but it ends far away from the sponge (final distance ≈ 3.3 m).  \n  • Trajectory 2: Even though its sequence deviates more from the expert commands, its final pose is much closer to the sponge (final distance ≈ 0.75 m).  \n3. Truncation  \n  • Neither episode was truncated.\n\nSince both cases failed the top priority, we look at the secondary metrics. Here the overall “progress” toward the goal (being near the sponge) is arguably very important. Despite Trajectory 2’s lower “expert action” alignment, its final position shows much more promise toward eventually grasping the sponge—if not for the collision. \n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 5. Conclusion  \nBecause of the much greater progress (ending up near the sponge) in Trajectory 2 compared to Trajectory 1, we conclude that, even though both collided, Trajectory 2 comes significantly closer to achieving the goal.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2565, "output_token_count": 5388}

Compared to the sponge position at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227], the robot in Trajectory 1 shows substantial progress by moving much closer to the sponge (reducing the overall distance from roughly 1.8 m to about 0.7 m).  \n• Trajectory 2 starts at [0.425, 0.009, –1.003] and ends at approximately [0.516, 0.009, –0.747]. Its improvement toward the sponge (which is at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) is minimal – only about a 0.23 m progress compared to a remaining distance over 3 m.  \n\nStep 3. Alignment with Expert Actions:  \n• Expert Actions 1 for Trajectory 1 are: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The robot followed the action “0” for the first nine steps (perfect matching) and then took a “1” in the tenth step which may have contributed to the collision.  \n• Expert Actions 2 for Trajectory 2 are: [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Trajectory 2 did not closely match these expert suggestions (e.g., using “1” or “2” inconsistently) so the expert-action alignment is significantly worse.\n\nStep 4. Final Evaluation:  \n• Both trajectories end in collision (highest priority), but Trajectory 1 showed far more progress toward the sponge and followed the expert’s actions much more closely prior to the fatal deviation.  \n• Therefore, even though both fail to achieve the goal due to collision, Trajectory 1 better approximates the intended motion toward the sponge and best follows the expert cues.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2589, "output_token_count": 2304}

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step by step:\n\n1. Success and collision (highest priority):  \n • In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 there are no collisions and no episode was marked as “success” (the sponge was not reached). So with respect to the primary goal the two segments are similar.\n\n2. Progress toward the goal and following expert actions (equal weight secondary):  \n a. Progress toward the sponge is measured not only by the absolute distance to the sponge but also by the progress made relative to the start‐to–goal displacement in that segment.  \n  – Trajectory 1 starts far from the target (roughly a 3.56m gap) and its final observation reduces that gap by only about 0.09m. Its movement along the “goal direction” is very small (roughly 0.10m projection along the vector to the target), which represents very little relative progress.  \n  – Trajectory 2 starts relatively close to the sponge (about 1.07m away) and moves about 0.14m along the direction toward the goal – a higher relative progress percentage compared to Trajectory 1.  \n b. Regarding agreement with expert actions:  \n  – For Trajectory 1, the expert actions provided ([1, 1, 0, 0]) share only a correct first step with the robot’s action sequence ([1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0]).  \n  – For Trajectory 2, comparing the robot’s actions ([1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0]) with the expert’s ([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]) shows a better match (for instance, many of the middle actions agree even though there is a mismatch at the very beginning and a couple later).  \n Thus, in terms of both making progress (when measured relative to where each segment started) and in aligning with the expert’s guidance, Trajectory 2 appears stronger.\n\n3.

Check terminal conditions:\n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 the episodes are ongoing (none ended with a success or a collision) so neither immediately “wins” on the most critical condition – success (or, equivalently, avoiding collision).\n\nStep 2. Evaluate progress:\n• For Trajectory 1, the robot begins at about [–0.276, 0.009, 1.306] and moves to [0.122, 0.0097, 1.391]. Its displacement along the vector toward the sponge (located at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) projects to roughly 0.136 m of progress from its starting point.\n• For Trajectory 2, the robot starts at about [2.401, 0.0087, –0.240] and ends at [2.477, 0.0092, –0.022]. When projected along the direction toward the sponge, its progress amounts to roughly 0.097 m.\nThus, Trajectory 1 achieves more progress toward the sponge relative to its own starting position.\n\nStep 3. Compare similarity to expert actions:\n• Trajectory 1’s actions are [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0], while the expert actions for a similar state are [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0].

In the initial steps there is only 1 match out of 4 (about 25% similarity).\nThus, Trajectory 1’s action sequence is closer to the expert’s prescribed actions.\n\nStep 4.

Progress Towards the Sponge and Agreement with Expert Actions:  \n • Progress: We compare the “distance to the sponge” from the start versus the end of each segment.  \n  – Trajectory 1 starts around (–1.775, …, –0.998) and ends near (–0.157, …, –0.944).

{"full_text": "Below is our step‐by‐step reasoning:\n\n1. Both segments ultimately ended the episode with success (no collisions and not truncated), so at the highest priority both achieved the goal. The next criteria are progress (i.e. motion toward the sponge from the segment’s starting position) and how well the robot’s actions align with the expert’s guidance.\n\n• In Trajectory 1 the robot’s position starts far away (approximately at x ≈ –2.02) and steadily moves forward so that at termination it is near x ≈ –0.14. (Recall the sponge is at roughly –0.11 in x.) Its actions are mainly “Move forward” after a single initial left turn. The expert action sequence (for a similar situation) is mostly “Move forward” (action 0) with only a couple of turns later. So despite a small deviation at the very start (taking a left when the expert would have gone forward) the overall motion is direct and consistent with expert actions and shows substantial progress toward the sponge.\n\n• In Trajectory 2 the robot starts at x ≈ 0.20 and ends at about x ≈ –0.05, so it makes only a modest change in x. Its action sequence has several turns (left, left, right, etc.) which do not follow the single‐step expert “forward” guidance (Expert Actions 2 is simply [0]).

{"full_text": "Step 1: Analysis\n\n• Success/Collision – Neither trajectory ended in a success (sponge reached) nor had a collision. Both segments are ongoing, so we must compare progress and action conformity.\n\n• Progress – In Trajectory 1 the robot’s positions remain nearly constant along the key dimensions. In fact, its first and last positions (roughly [–1.514, 0.0306, 1.418]) show almost no displacement. Given the sponge’s position is about [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227], the robot did not move closer to it relative to its starting point. In Trajectory 2 the robot starts at [–1.772, 0.009, –1.499] and by the end is around [–0.293, 0.009, –1.469]. Although the positions are not an exact match to the sponge’s coordinates, relative to its own starting point it has progressed along the direction toward the sponge (especially along the x‐axis). A projected progress calculation shows that Trajectory 2 achieves a measurable displacement toward the goal while Trajectory 1 does not.\n\n• Action conformity – In Trajectory 1 the robot executed the same turning action (always action 2) even though the expert’s actions indicate that the first step should be to move forward (action 0) then possibly turn (action 2) and mostly forward motion afterward. Almost every robot action in Trajectory 1 disagrees with the expert. In Trajectory 2 the robot mainly takes action 0 (move forward) for the first several steps, which is more in line with the expert’s leading sequence—even if it begins slightly off (the expert suggested 1 at the very first step in Expert Actions 2, the rest are mostly forward). Thus Trajectory 2 more closely follows the expert’s behavior by making forward progress.\n\nStep 2: Conclusion\nSince neither trajectory completed the episode (no success/collision), we compare progress and expert action mimicry. Trajectory 2 shows clear progress towards the sponge and a sequence of actions more aligned with the expert guidance compared to Trajectory 1, whose robot was essentially just rotating in place.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2661, "output_token_count": 3088}
{"full_text": "Step 1. Goal (Success/Collision) Analysis:\n• Both trajectories did not complete the episode by reaching the sponge (success is false) and neither collided.\n• Thus, from the primary “success/collision” criterion, both trajectories are similar.\n\nStep 2. Progress and Expert Action Similarity:\n• Trajectory 1 shows clear spatial advancement. Its observations indicate that the robot moved along the environment (for example, its x‐coordinate moved from around –1.77 toward –0.29, closer to the sponge’s x position of approximately –0.11).

{"full_text": "Step 1. Check for Success or Collision (Highest Priority):  \n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2, the final observation shows that the episode ended with a termination flag and a collision (collision value “1” on the last step), while neither provided a “success”.

Evaluate Progress Toward the Sponge and Comparison with Expert Actions (Second Priority):  \n• Progress:  \n – Trajectory 1 begins at approximately [–1.50, 0.01] (ignoring z) with a horizontal distance of about 1.49 m to the sponge (sponge ≈ [–0.11, 0.533]). By the final step its horizontal position is near [–0.317, 0.009], reducing the error to about 0.56 m.

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the analysis step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Success/Collision:  \n • Neither trajectory reached the goal nor encountered a collision (all “success” are false and “collision” is zero), so neither has the “immediate” episode‐ending event. We must therefore use the “progress” and “action alignment” information.\n\n2. Progress Relative to the Sponge:  \n • The target sponge is at approximately (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227).  \n • In Trajectory 1 the robot’s positions are roughly (–1.85, 0.009, 2.405) initially and later (–1.70, 0.009, 2.338). Its overall distance from the sponge decreases from about 1.83 m to about 1.68 m. In addition, the z‑coordinate is near the sponge’s z and the improvement, though small, shows some motion toward the goal.  \n • In Trajectory 2 the start is roughly (–0.10, 0.009, –1.18) moving to around (–0.236, 0.009, –1.05). When compared with the sponge’s coordinates the distance remains large (~3.45 m down to ~3.32 m) primarily because the z‑coordinate is very far off (around –1.1 vs 2.23).  \n → Trajectory 1 is clearly “closer” and has made better progress relative to the sponge position.\n\n3. Alignment with Expert Actions:  \n • For Trajectory 1, the expert provided only a single expert action [0] (which corresponds to “move forward”) and in Trajectory 1 the first two actions are 0 (move forward). That shows an initial match with the expert notion of “go straight toward the target”.  \n • For Trajectory 2, the expert action sequence is longer and begins with a left-turn (action 1). The robot’s first action is 1 (match) but subsequent actions diverge considerably from the expert sequence.  \n → Although both trajectories have some mismatches later on, given that the expert’s provided cues in Trajectory 1 lead with move-forward and the robot in Trajectory 1 follows that initially, its action choices appear a closer match to what the expert intended in a similar situation.\n\n4. Truncation:  \n • Neither trajectory is truncated so this factor does not affect the outcome.\n\nTaking into account all of these factors – no early episode termination, progress towards the sponge, and some consistency with expert actions – Trajectory 1 is slightly better headed toward the goal because it is overall physically closer to the sponge and its initial actions match the “move forward” expert advice.\n\nThus, the goal is better achieved in Trajectory 1.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2598, "output_token_count": 3157}

Although its x‐coordinate is already almost aligned with the sponge, nearly all of the required movement toward the sponge is in the y and z directions (e.g. from y ≈ 0.009 to 0.533 and from z ≈ –1.179 to 2.227). In Trajectory 1 the movement toward these critical coordinates is minimal (a very small change in z and almost none in y). When projecting the actual movement onto the ideal direction (from the segment’s start to the sponge), the effective progress is only around 0.128 units; given the overall required distance of roughly 3.45 units, that’s only a few percent progress.\n\n• For Trajectory 2, the starting position is (–1.851, 0.009, 2.405) and by the end the robot is at (–1.703, 0.009, 2.338). Although the overall distance from the sponge was shorter (roughly 1.83 units away at start), the robot’s motion in this segment (an increase in x and a decrease in z) is in the direction of the sponge. A projection of its movement onto the direction toward the sponge shows about 0.147 units of progress – a larger fraction of the required progress when normalized by the starting gap.\n\nStep 3. Compare following expert actions:\n• In Trajectory 1 the robot’s actions (1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, …) only partially agree with the expert’s sequence (which starts with repeated action 1 then zeros). There is a significant divergence.\n• In Trajectory 2, although only a single expert action (0) is provided, the very first robot action is 0, matching the expert recommendation. This is not a full comparison, but it signals that the robot’s initial decision was in agreement with the expert.\n\nStep 4. Overall Evaluation:\nSince both trajectories do not end in success or collision, our focus is on progress toward the goal and adherence to expert-like behavior. Trajectory 2 shows a clearer movement in the correct direction (improving both in x and z toward the sponge) and its actions start off in line with the expert. By contrast, Trajectory 1 shows only minimal effective progress and a less consistent action match.\n\nThus, Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2598, "output_token_count": 3581}

Evaluating progress: In Trajectory 1 the robot’s position steadily moves from an x‐value of about 1.52 toward the sponge’s x ≈ –0.109. The distance from the robot to the sponge shrinks significantly (from roughly 1.7 m away down to approximately 0.55 m by the last observation).

{"full_text": "Step 1. Neither segment has reached a terminal “success” (nor caused a collision or truncation), so we must compare how much progress was made and how well the actions agree with the expert. \n\n• Looking at progress relative to the sponge position, note that the “sponge” is at approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. In Trajectory 1 the positions start around [0.169, 0.009, –0.879] and end near [–0.315, 0.009, –0.852]. Although the x‐position shifts toward the sponge’s x value, there is nearly no change in the z coordinate; overall the improvement in proximity (when computed relative each segment’s starting distance to the target) is very minimal.\n\n• In Trajectory 2, the positions start at around [–0.976, 0.009, 1.175] and evolve to [0.085, 0.009, 1.324].

{"full_text": "Let’s break this down by following our priorities:\n\n1. (Success/Collision) – Both trajectories never reached the sponge (success is false) and neither experienced a collision (collision = 0 throughout). In that sense, neither “completed” the goal via success, but there is no highly detrimental collision in either.\n\n2. (Progress and similarity to expert actions) – Here we must compare both the relative progress toward the sponge and how closely the robot’s actions follow the expert’s suggested actions, giving equal weight for this tier.\n • Looking at progress: Although the starting positions are different, if we consider only the horizontal plane (the x and y coordinates) to measure “progress” toward the sponge (whose x,y are roughly [–0.109, 0.533]), then for Trajectory 1 the distance from the robot’s position to the sponge decreased by roughly 0.08 m (from about 1.65 m to 1.57 m). For Trajectory 2, the improvement is almost negligible (roughly 0.003 m reduction in distance), meaning Trajectory 1 makes comparatively better progress.\n • Then, considering following the expert’s actions: \n  – Trajectory 1’s action sequence (2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0) has two time steps that match the expert’s (Expert Actions 1: [2, 0, 0, 0, …,0]) – specifically the first and last steps.\n  – Trajectory 2’s actions (0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1) align even less well when comparing the first 10 steps with the expert’s (Expert Actions 2, whose first 10 actions are [2, 0, 0, 0, …,0]). \nThus, relative to the expert recommendation, Trajectory 1 is a closer match.\n\n3. (Truncation) – Trajectory 1 ended with truncation (the episode was cut off, perhaps for taking too many steps or drifting too far). Trajectory 2 was not truncated. However, since truncation is the lowest–priority criterion (only applied after success/collision and progress—both of which are more important), this does not outweigh the superior progress and action similarity shown by Trajectory 1.\n\nOverall, neither trajectory reached the goal (success) without collision, but Trajectory 1 made more measurable progress toward the sponge and more closely mimicked expert actions, even though it ended by truncation.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2660, "output_token_count": 2927}

Success/Collision:  \n • For both trajectories there was no success (the robot never reached the sponge) and no collision. So on the highest‐priority indicator, they are equivalent. \n\n2. Progress and Expert Alignment:  \n • Progress means reducing the distance to the sponge relative to the segment’s start. Trajectory 1’s positions (after accounting for the goal’s known coordinates) indicate a reduction in the gap by roughly 0.11 m, whereas Trajectory 2’s relative progress is only about 0.02 m.  \n • Concerning following expert actions (with experts largely recommending “move forward” [action 0] except at a few points), a quick alignment of the robot’s chosen actions with the expert’s reveals that Trajectory 2’s action sequence (2 out of 10 steps matching) slightly outperforms Trajectory 1 (only 1 out of 10 matching).  \n • Since we weigh progress and expert imitation equally, Trajectory 1’s clearly higher improvement toward the goal (about 0.11 m vs. 0.02 m in progress) compensates for its slightly poorer expert alignment.\n\n3. Truncation:  \n • Note that Trajectory 2 ends with a truncation flag set to true (the episode was cut off).

Evaluate Progress Toward the Goal\n\nAlthough neither trajectory succeeded, we can still judge how much they moved “toward” the sponge. (Note that progress is measured relative to the segment’s starting location.)\n\nThe target (sponge) is at position: \n  [-0.109, 0.533, 2.227]\n\nFor each trajectory, we compare the Euclidean distance from the robot’s starting position in the segment to the sponge with the distance at the final observation.

Compare Following of Expert Actions\n\nBoth trajectories list a sequence of robot actions and are accompanied by an expert action sequence.\n \n• For Trajectory 1, comparing the first 10 actions to the expert actions (using the corresponding first 10 expert moves of Expert Actions 1):\n – Trajectory 1’s actions: [1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n – Expert (first 10): [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n – They match in about 4 out of 10 steps.\n\n• For Trajectory 2, doing the same with Expert Actions 2:\n – Trajectory 2’s actions: [1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0]\n – Expert (first 10): [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n – They also match in about 4 out of 10 steps.\n\nThus, on following expert recommendations, the two trajectories are largely comparable.\n\n────────────────────────\nStep 4.

Assess progress:\n• Trajectory 1 begins at a robot position around (1.51, 0.0095, 1.50) and ends around (0.97, 0.0098, 1.60). Compared with the sponge’s position (approximately –0.109, 0.533, 2.227), the Euclidean distance to the goal drops from roughly 1.85 m to about 1.35 m—indicating decent forward progress.\n• Trajectory 2 starts around (–0.241, 0.0096, –1.048) and ends around (–0.228, 0.0096, –0.985).

This shows more significant progress toward the goal relative to its starting point.\n\nStep 3: Compare adherence to expert actions.\n• Expert Actions for Trajectory 1 (provided as [2, 0, 0, 0, …]) versus the robot’s actions ([1, 2, 1, 1, …]) show little agreement (the very first action already differs).\n• In Trajectory 2, the expert gives [0, 0, 0, 0, …] and the robot’s first three actions are [0, 0, 0], matching well initially. Even though later actions deviate somewhat, the early sequence’s alignment is promising.\n• Thus, Trajectory 2 better follows the expert’s intended actions, at least in the initial part of the segment.\n\nStep 4: Overall assessment.\n• Since both trajectories have no terminal outcomes (no collision or success) the evaluation places weight on progress and matching expert actions.\n• Trajectory 2 not only shows considerably more progress (a larger reduction in distance to the sponge) but also better matches the expert’s actions in its early steps.\n• Therefore, Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal based on the given priorities.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2590, "output_token_count": 2903}

{"full_text": "Let's break down the evaluation step‐by‐step.\n\n1. Success/Collision:  \n• In both trajectories, there is no collision and the robot did not reach the sponge (no success). So the highest‐priority condition is the same for both.\n\n2. Progress:  \n• For progress we must look at how much closer the robot got to the sponge relative to where it started in the segment.  \n – In Trajectory 1 the robot’s starting distance to the sponge is roughly 1.43 m and its ending distance is about 1.19 m – a reduction of roughly 0.24 m.  \n – In Trajectory 2 the starting distance is about 4.08 m and the ending distance is about 3.76 m – a reduction of 0.32 m.  \nHowever, since the instructions require us to consider how much the robot moved “towards” the sponge relative to its starting distance, we compute the relative progress. Trajectory 1’s 0.24 m improvement from 1.43 m is about a 16–17% improvement, whereas Trajectory 2’s 0.32 m improvement from 4.08 m is roughly a 8% improvement. Thus relative to where each started, Trajectory 1 shows greater progress.\n\n3. Expert Action Following:  \n• For Trajectory 1, the expert action sequence is [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] but the taken actions are [2, 1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2] – only one out of ten actions (at step 6) lines up with the expert.  \n• For Trajectory 2, if we compare the first 10 of the expert actions [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2] with the taken actions [2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1], we see matches on step 0 and steps 3–8 (7 matching out of 10).  \nThus Trajectory 2 follows the expert’s actions much better.\n\n4. Overall:  \nSince neither trajectory achieved the goal (failure to reach sponge or collision) the next criteria – progress and matching the expert’s actions – become equally important. Although Trajectory 1 shows a higher (relative) progress percentage (about 17% versus 8%), Trajectory 2 very clearly follows the expert’s actions (70% matching compared to about 10% matching in Trajectory 1). When weighing these two equally, the strong action agreement in Trajectory 2 likely outweighs the somewhat better relative progress seen in Trajectory 1.\n\nTherefore, overall, Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2646, "output_token_count": 3824}

Thus, neither one ended decisively via success or collision.\n• We then compare progress (how far each robot moved toward the sponge relative to its starting point) and the similarity to expert actions.\n – Trajectory 1 starts at a position around (–1.714, …) and ends near (–0.458, …). Relative to the goal at approximately (–0.109, 0.533, …), this trajectory shows a displacement of about 0.5 meters along the directed vector from its start to the goal.\n – Trajectory 2 starts at (0.405, …) and ends at (0.233, …), which computes to roughly 0.24 meters of progress toward its goal (when measured along the line from its respective starting point to (–0.109, …)).\n• Next, comparing expert action agreement:\n – In Trajectory 1 (using a relevant slice of the 10 actions), the action sequence has matches on 7 out of 10 steps (e.g. the first action “2” matches, several “0” moves match, with only a few deviations).\n – In Trajectory 2 the provided 10-step sequence only matches the expert on 1 out of 10 steps.\nThus, Trajectory 1 not only demonstrates more progress toward the sponge relative to its starting location but also follows the expert trajectory much more closely.\n\nStep 2 – Final Answer:\nBased on the priorities (success/collision first, then progress and expert similarity, then truncation) Trajectory 1 is better.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2646, "output_token_count": 3048}

Reaching the sponge (i.e. a success outcome) is the highly desired result. A collision is highly undesirable. Therefore based on the most‐critical criterion (success vs. collision), neither trajectory achieves the goal.\n\nStep 2: Considering Secondary Criteria – Progress and Expert Action Alignment\n• Even though both trajectories “fail” in that they end in collision, we next consider the progress they made toward the sponge (and how well they would follow expert actions where available).\n• For Trajectory 1, the robot’s starting position (approximately [–1.50, 0.009, 0.067]) and its final position (around [–1.05, 0.01, 0.08]) show an improvement in distance toward the sponge (given as roughly [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]). However, the improvement (roughly 0.22 m closer in Euclidean terms) is modest.\n• For Trajectory 2, starting at about [1.97, 0.009, –0.37] and ending at about [1.30, 0.009, 0.17] the progress toward the sponge is larger (approximately 0.82 m improvement when comparing the distance from the sponge at the start vs. end of the segment).\n• In terms of expert actions, Trajectory 1 can be compared against a provided expert sequence – and here the robot’s turns (actions 1 and 2) show divergence from the expert’s predominantly forward (action 0) steps. Trajectory 2 does not have an expert action sequence provided, so no comparison is possible there.\n\nStep 3: Final Assessment and Priorities\n• Priority 1 (“success or collision”) is decisive: Both trajectories ended in collision, so from a pure safety/success standpoint neither achieves the goal.\n• However, using the secondary priority of “progress toward the target” (and then expert imitation), Trajectory 2 has a clear edge with a larger relative progress toward the sponge.\n• Neither trajectory is truncated, so that aspect does not alter the evaluation.\n\nEven though both outcomes are ultimately failures in terms of success, when we consider “how well the robot was progressing” (and partially expert alignment for Trajectory 1), Trajectory 2 shows better relative progress toward the target.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2605, "output_token_count": 2646}

{"full_text": "Step 1. Success/Collision Check:\n• Both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 are incomplete (none reached the sponge, no collision, and no truncation).\n• Hence, neither trajectory “succeeded” nor had a collision.\n\nStep 2. Progress Towards the Sponge:\n• In Trajectory 1, using the first three observation values as the robot’s position, the robot moved from an initial distance of about 3.455 m away from the sponge to about 3.418 m—a small improvement (≈0.037 m closer).\n• In Trajectory 2, the robot started about 2.023 m from the sponge but ended roughly 2.062 m away—indicating it moved about 0.039 m farther away.\n• Thus, Trajectory 1 shows slight progress toward the goal, whereas Trajectory 2 shows regression.\n\nStep 3. Following Expert Actions:\n• Expert Actions for Trajectory 1 were all “move forward” (action 0). Trajectory 1 starts with a correct forward move, but then uses several turns (actions 1 and 2) that diverge from the expert’s prescription.\n• For Trajectory 2, although there is a longer expert sequence, the robot’s actions only briefly align (the very first action is 0), with most subsequent actions differing.\n• Both trajectories deviate to a similar degree; however, combined with progress, the slight forward progress in Trajectory 1 gives it an edge.\n\nStep 4. Final Evaluation Considering Priorities:\n• Neither trajectory has achieved success or met a collision condition, so the next evaluation criteria are progress and expert-action alignment.\n• Trajectory 1 shows a small improvement toward the sponge while Trajectory 2 moves slightly away.\n• Although neither follows the expert actions closely, Trajectory 1’s progress is in the right direction.\n\nTherefore, comparing both segments under all criteria, Trajectory 1 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2596, "output_token_count": 2456}
{"full_text": "Step 1. Goal Achievement Check:\n• Both trajectories are still ongoing—they had no collision, no success (i.e. neither reached the sponge) and neither was truncated. Therefore, the “first‐priority” outcome (success/collision) is not reached in either case.\n• We then must compare progress toward the goal and adherence to expert actions.\n\nStep 2. Evaluating Progress:\n• The sponge is at approximately (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227). In Trajectory 1, the robot starts near (–2.00, 0.009, 1.732) and ends near (–2.055, 0.010, 1.789). The displacement from the start (relative to the vector from the start to the goal) turns out to be slightly negative (i.e. when projected onto the “goal direction,” the robot moved backward). Its overall distance to the goal did not decrease—in fact it slightly increased.\n• In Trajectory 2, the robot starts at about (0.545, 0.009, –1.125) and ends at (0.454, 0.009, –1.103). Although the overall change is small, the displacement projected along the vector toward the sponge is modestly positive. In other words, Trajectory 2 shows slight progress toward the sponge.\n\nStep 3. Evaluating Adherence to Expert Actions:\n• For Trajectory 1, the expert sequence (0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0) shares the first action (0) with the executed action sequence but then diverges in several steps.\n• For Trajectory 2, the expert sequence provided (0,0,0,0,0,0) has the same starting action (0) but the remaining actions also diverge.\n• In both cases, the executed actions are not a very close match to the expert actions. Given equal weighting with progress, the slight progress in Trajectory 2 makes a difference.\n\nStep 4. Overall Comparison:\n• Neither trajectory reached the goal, but when considering progress toward the sponge—with a proper check relative to each trajectory’s starting location—and given that both did not incur collisions or truncations, Trajectory 2 shows a marginally positive progress towards the goal while Trajectory 1 appears to have moved slightly away.\n• Although the agreement with expert actions is not perfect in either case, the positive progress of Trajectory 2 gives it the edge.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2596, "output_token_count": 2775}

{"full_text": "Step 1. Check for Success/Collision:\n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2, none of the observations indicate that the robot reached the sponge (success remains false) or had any collision (collision always 0). So, at the highest‐priority level, both are equal.\n\nStep 2. Evaluate Progress (and adherence to expert actions where available):\n• We measure progress by comparing the robot’s distance from the sponge at the beginning versus the end of the segment. Using the given sponge position ([-0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) and the robot positions from the trajectories:\n – Trajectory 1: The initial observation (≈[–1.394, 0.009, 2.067]) is about 1.40 m from the sponge, while the final observation (≈[–1.747, 0.010, 2.767]) is about 1.80 m away. This shows that the robot, relative to its own start, moved further away from the goal.\n – Trajectory 2: The initial observation (≈[–1.672, 0.009, 2.684]) is around 1.71 m from the sponge, and the final observation (≈[–1.587, 0.010, 2.751]) is about 1.65 m away, indicating a modest improvement toward the sponge.\n• In addition, Trajectory 1’s expert actions are provided (mostly forward moves), yet the robot’s actions in Trajectory 1 (a mix of turns and forwards) do not align well with the straightforward “move forward” advocated by the expert. For Trajectory 2, no expert actions are provided; hence, we focus on progress. Even though we can’t compare expert alignment in Trajectory 2, the measurable progress toward the sponge (albeit small) is better than the regression seen in Trajectory 1.\n\nStep 3. Consider Truncation:\n• Both trajectories end with the truncated flag true, suggesting the episode was cut off (likely due to too many steps). However, truncation is the lowest‐priority criterion. It does not overcome the fact that Trajectory 2 shows a small improvement (progress) while Trajectory 1 did not.\n\nConclusion:\n• Both trajectories fail to complete the task (no success and no collisions), but Trajectory 2 shows slight progress toward the sponge, while Trajectory 1 actually increases the separation from the goal and deviates from the expert’s straight-forward “move forward” action. \n\nTherefore, Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2590, "output_token_count": 2727}

Neither trajectory reached the sponge, so neither completed the goal.  \n\nStep 2. Progress and Expert Action Comparison:  \n• For Trajectory 1, computing progress from the start toward the known sponge position shows a small movement in the proper direction (a modest positive displacement along the line between the start and the sponge).  \n• For Trajectory 2, when we compare the robot’s displacement from its starting observation with the vector toward the sponge, the dot product is negative—indicating the robot is moving in the opposite direction from the sponge.  \n• Additionally, while an expert action sequence is provided for Trajectory 2, its actual actions differ significantly from the expert (for example, beginning with 1 rather than the expert’s preferred 0), further reducing its quality despite the availability of expert data for comparison. Trajectory 1 has no expert actions for comparison, but its relative progress is still better.  \n\nStep 3. Truncation:  \n• Both trajectories end because of truncation.

{"full_text": "We must weigh all the factors. In Trajectory 1 the robot makes some progress toward the sponge (its x‐coordinate increases from about –1.724 to –1.049, suggesting that it is moving toward the goal at –0.109), but it eventually terminates with a collision (collision flag “2” at the final observation). A collision is highly detrimental and takes absolute precedence over any progress made.\n\nIn contrast, Trajectory 2 shows almost no change in position (the robot’s coordinates remain near –1.174, with very minor fluctuations). Although there is little progress, there is no collision or termination. No success is reached (nor a clear alignment with expert actions), but because the collision is the highest‐priority negative outcome, its avoidance in Trajectory 2 makes it a better trajectory even if it hasn’t made much progress.\n\nThus, while Trajectory 1 demonstrates movement toward the target before a collision, Trajectory 2 avoids the detrimental collision and remains safe.

The expert’s sequence is mostly forward moves (0’s), so Trajectory 2 consistently diverges from the expert’s expected actions.\n\nStep 4.

First, neither trajectory shows a termination via success (reaching the sponge) nor a collision – both remain “ongoing” without a final done flag. So for the highest‐priority criterion (success vs. collision), both are equal.\n\n2. The next priorities are (a) how much progress they make toward the sponge relative to their starting positions and (b) how well they follow the expert actions.\n\n  • For progress, we compare the displacement of the robot along the direction from its starting pose to the sponge. In Trajectory 1, the robot started at about [1.76, …, –1.50] and ended near [0.89, …, –1.45]. The net movement in the direction of the sponge was modest when compared to the full distance from the start to the sponge. In Trajectory 2 the robot started at roughly [1.50, …, 0.98] and ended at about [0.41, …, 0.986]. When computing the component of the movement in the direction of the sponge (by taking a dot‐product with the vector from start to sponge), Trajectory 2 shows that it made a considerably larger fraction of the required progress than Trajectory 1.\n\n  • For expert action agreement, note the expert actions for both trajectories were all zeros. In Trajectory 1 the taken action sequence (0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, …) starts aligned with the expert but then deviates (with turns 1 and 2) over several steps. In contrast, Trajectory 2’s sequence (starting with 1 but then a long run of zeros, with only a couple of extra turns at the end) aligns much better with the expert’s recommendation in most steps. Comparing the first several actions, Trajectory 2 more closely follows the expert than Trajectory 1 does.\n\n3. The final criterion (truncation) is not triggered in either case.\n\nCombining these: While neither trajectory has ended in success (or a collision), Trajectory 2 shows significantly better progress relative to its start position toward the sponge and adheres more closely to the expert’s action sequence.

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Neither segment ended the episode (no success, no collision, and no truncation), so we must look at progress (i.e. moving toward the sponge) and how well the robot’s actions agree with the expert’s actions. Keep in mind that the progress must be measured relative to each segment’s starting point and along the direction from that starting point to the sponge.\n\n• For Trajectory 1 the starting position is about (–0.183, 0.0092, 1.1745) and its final position is roughly (0.220, 0.0095, 1.201). When we compute the displacement along the vector from the starting point to the sponge (whose coordinates are approximately (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227)), the progress along that direction is very small – on the order of only 5% of the required travel distance. In addition, when comparing the taken actions [1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0] to the expert’s sequence, about half of the actions match.\n\n• For Trajectory 2 the starting position is about (–1.770, 0.00925, –1.5011) and its final position is about (–0.6740, 0.00903, –1.2943). Although in absolute distance this final point is still far from the sponge, the proper way to gauge progress is to see how far the robot has advanced along the line to the sponge from its own starting point. In this case, the displacement projects to nearly 2.59 units along the (start-to-sponge) direction, and the total required distance (from its starting point) is around 4.12 units – an approximate progress of 63%. In addition, when comparing the actions [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2, 0] with the expert actions for Trajectory 2 (first 10 actions from the expert sequence [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, …]), about 6 out of 10 actions match (60% match).\n\n2. Overall, both trajectories avoid collisions and neither terminates early, but Trajectory 1 barely makes progress toward the sponge (only about 5% progress) and its actions follow the expert only about half the time; Trajectory 2, though starting from a very different (and farther away) point, makes significant progress (about 63% along the needed direction) and its actions are closer to the expert’s recommendations (about 60% match).\n\nThus, Trajectory 2 better advances the robot toward the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2608, "output_token_count": 4197}

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step‐by‐step:\n\n1. Success/Collision (Highest priority):  \n • In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2, there is no collision and no success reported – they are both still “ongoing.”  \n  → So nothing distinguishes them on this most critical metric.\n\n2. Progress and Following the Expert’s Actions (Equal weight):  \n Progress is measured not merely by absolute distance to the sponge (whose position is [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) but by how the robot has moved relative to its own starting position in the segment toward that target.  \n  • For Trajectory 1, the robot starts at roughly (–0.102, 0.0097, 1.212) and ends at (–0.916, 0.0094, 1.505). Although the overall Euclidean distance to the sponge (when measured directly) increases only slightly, by examining the displacement relative to the direction from the starting point to the sponge the robot shows a small positive component in the “correct” direction.  \n  • In contrast, Trajectory 2 starts at about (0.452, 0.0089, 1.504) and ends at (0.744, 0.0094, 1.571). When we compute the displacement relative to the vector from the start to the sponge, Trajectory 2 actually registers a negative component – meaning its movement is in the opposite direction of where the sponge lies.  \n\n Next, checking adherence to expert actions:  \n  • Trajectory 1’s actions (1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0) compared with its expert-provided actions ([0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) line up in several steps (about 40% matching in the aligned portion).  \n  • Trajectory 2’s actions (2, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2) are compared to a shorter expert sequence ([1, 1, 0]). In the first few steps the robot is clearly not matching the expert (for example, expert expects “1” then “1” while the robot did “2” then “2”).  \n\n Thus, with equal weight to progress and following expert actions, Trajectory 1 shows a modest positive displacement in the right direction and some alignment with the expert, whereas Trajectory 2 actually “moves away” relative to where the sponge is and does not follow the expert’s recommended actions.\n\n3. Truncation:  \n Both trajectories do not indicate truncation, so there is no difference here.\n\nConclusion: Although neither trajectory reached the goal or encountered a collision, Trajectory 1 clearly makes better progress toward the sponge and follows the expert actions better than Trajectory 2.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2573, "output_token_count": 4683}
{"full_text": "Step 1. Check for Termination Conditions (Priority 1):\n• Neither trajectory ends with success (reaching the sponge) nor with a collision.\n• Both trajectories are ongoing (not terminated nor truncated).\n→ So neither trajectory reaches the goal yet.\n\nStep 2. Evaluate Progress Toward the Sponge and Expert Action Alignment (Priority 2):\n• Progress: We must consider how far the robot has moved toward the sponge relative to its starting point.\n  – For Trajectory 1, the starting robot position is about (0.452, 0.009) while the sponge is at (–0.109, 0.533). The vector indicates that from the start the robot should move in a roughly negative-x and positive-y direction over a distance of about 0.77 m. However, the final position in Trajectory 1 ends around (0.744, 0.009), which computes to a displacement that actually moves away (a negative dot‐product with the “toward sponge” unit vector by roughly –0.21 m).\n  – For Trajectory 2, the starting position is about (–0.102, 0.010) with the sponge again at (–0.109, 0.533) — a difference of roughly (–0.007, 0.523), or about 0.52 m away. The final position ends at (–0.916, 0.009), which along the direction toward the sponge yields a nearly zero to very slight positive progress.\n• Expert Action Alignment:\n  – In Trajectory 1 the expert actions provided were [1, 1, 0] (i.e. turn left, turn left, move forward) but the robot’s first three actions were [2, 2, 2] (turn right three times). This is a poor match.\n  – In Trajectory 2 the expert actions provided ([0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) differ from the robot’s sequence ([1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0]), but there are several instances (for example, several of the later moves) where the robot’s actions match or are closer to the expert suggestion.\n• Overall on Priority 2, Trajectory 2 is doing slightly better—it is not moving away from the goal (while Trajectory 1 appears to regress) and its actions are closer in parts to expert guidance.\n\nStep 3. Truncation (Priority 3):\n• Neither trajectory has been truncated (no excessive steps or leaving the room).\n\nStep 4. Overall Comparison: \n• Both trajectories are ongoing with no collision/success; however, Trajectory 2 shows a slight positive progress toward the sponge and a better partial match with expert actions compared to Trajectory 1.\n• Thus, considering all factors and the priorities outlined, Trajectory 2 appears to better achieve the goal (progressing toward the sponge and following expert cues more closely).\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2573, "output_token_count": 4112}

{"full_text": "Step 1 – Success/Collision Check:\n• Neither trajectory shows a terminal success (i.e. reaching the sponge) nor any collision. Both trajectories have ongoing episodes with no termination or truncation. This means that on the highest priority (success vs. collision) they are effectively tied.\n\nStep 2 – Progress Toward the Goal:\n• The goal is for the robot to get closer to the sponge position at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. Although the segments start at different positions, progress is measured by how much closer the robot gets to the sponge relative to its own starting position.\n• For Trajectory 1, the initial observation is approximately [0.456, 0.009, –1.053] and the final observation is around [0.206, 0.009, –0.858]. Computing Euclidean distances to the sponge shows an improvement of roughly 0.23 m.\n• In Trajectory 2, the starting observation is approximately [–1.619, 0.009, 1.482] and the final observation is about [–1.353, 0.009, 1.829]. The computed distances to the sponge decrease by roughly 0.36 m.\n• Thus, Trajectory 2 shows a slightly larger amount of progress in moving toward the sponge.\n\nStep 3 – Matching the Expert Actions:\n• Expert Actions for Trajectory 1 are [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0] while the robot’s actions are [1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1]. There are several mismatches.\n• Expert Actions for Trajectory 2 are [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] (using the first 10 for comparison) versus the robot’s actions of [1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1]. Again there are mismatches.\n• Neither trajectory follows the expert very closely in the sampled segments; however, since expert similarity is weighted equally with progress (and both are suboptimal here), the slight advantage goes to better progress.\n\nStep 4 – Conclusion:\n• While neither trajectory reached the goal, Trajectory 2 exhibits a greater reduction in distance to the sponge compared to Trajectory 1. With no collisions or terminations to penalize either and given that both progress and closeness to the expert actions are considered (with progress slightly favoring Trajectory 2), Trajectory 2 appears to better achieve the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2590, "output_token_count": 2692}

Its final pose is roughly (–1.35, ~0.009, 1.83).

Truncation is not an issue here since neither trajectory was truncated.\n\nGiven that achieving success (or avoiding collision) is the foremost priority and Trajectory 2 reports a successful episode (despite starting at a different location), it is clear that Trajectory 2 better achieved the goal of reaching the sponge.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2581, "output_token_count": 1366}

{"full_text": "Let’s break the evaluation into the three prioritized factors:\n\n1. Success/Collision: \n • Neither trajectory ends with a success (the robot reaching the sponge) nor with a collision. So both are equal on this highly critical factor.\n\n2. Progress Toward the Sponge and Following Expert Actions:\n a. Progress:\n  – Note that the segments start at different points. For Trajectory 1 the starting pose (first observation) is about (1.015, 0.009, –1.341), and the final pose is (0.192, 0.010, –1.279). In a rough “move-away” sense from the initial distance to the fixed sponge position ([-0.109, 0.533, 2.227]), Trajectory 1 shows a net improvement by shifting significantly toward the target. By projecting the motion onto the direction toward the sponge we estimate a progress of roughly 0.30 m.\n  – Trajectory 2 begins near (–0.076, 0.009, 1.265) and ends at (0.357, 0.009, 1.369). Although its starting point is closer in raw distance (around 1.1 m away from the sponge) the movement made during the segment only advances toward the sponge by about 0.08 m.\n b. Expert Action Matching:\n  – In Trajectory 1 (actions: 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0) compared against an expert sequence (first 10 steps roughly: 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), about 50% of the actions agree.\n  – In Trajectory 2 (actions: 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0) compared to its expert actions (0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0), about 70% of the actions match.\n c. Combined (Progress and Expert Actions – equal weight):\n  – Trajectory 1 demonstrates clear progress (a progress score that is roughly 3–4 times that of Trajectory 2) even though it deviates more from the expert actions.\n  – Trajectory 2 follows the expert more closely but barely reduces the distance toward the goal.\n When judging these equally weighted criteria, the larger progress advantage of Trajectory 1 outweighs the better adherence of Trajectory 2.\n\n3. Truncation:\n • Neither trajectory was truncated.\n\nConclusion:\nBoth trajectories avoid collisions and neither finishes successfully. However, Trajectory 1 shows significantly more progress toward the sponge even though its actions match the expert less closely, while Trajectory 2, although following the expert better, hardly moves closer to the goal. Since progress (moving toward the sponge) and expert guidance are equally weighted after the safety criterion, Trajectory 1 overall better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2640, "output_token_count": 4256}
{"full_text": "Let’s break down the factors step by step:\n\n1. Both trajectories did not “finish” (they did not reach the sponge and did not collide), so the highest‐priority outcome (success/collision) is the same for both. That leaves us with looking at progress toward the goal and how well the robot followed the expert’s actions. (Truncation is also false for both, so it does not contribute here.)\n\n• Progress: Because the segments may begin at different places, we compare how much the robot moved closer to the sponge relative to its own starting position. For Trajectory 1 the robot’s distance to the sponge (using its position from the first observation compared with the sponge’s position) was already relatively short (about 1.1 m) but hardly changed during the segment. In contrast, Trajectory 2 started much farther (about 3.8 m away) but “improved” its distance by roughly 0.22 m. In other words, relative to where it started, the robot in Trajectory 2 is making measurable progress.\n\n• Expert Actions: For Trajectory 1 the actual actions match the expert actions in 7 out of 10 steps (around 70% matching), whereas for Trajectory 2 (comparing the first 10 expert actions) about 5 out of 10 actions match (around 50%). Thus, Trajectory 1 more closely imitates the expert’s recommended behavior.\n\nWhen combining these factors under equal weight, we see a trade‐off. Trajectory 1 started very near the target but did not make further progress even though its actions match the expert more closely. Trajectory 2, while less aligned with the expert’s actions, did show a noticeable improvement toward the sponge relative to its own starting position.\n\nSince the ultimate goal is to reach the sponge (and success is defined by progress toward that goal), the demonstrated progress is critical. In our evaluation, making measurable head‐way toward the sponge (even if starting farther away and with slightly less expert conformity) is a key indicator that the robot is “getting there.”\n\n2. Based on these considerations, Trajectory 2 appears to be the one that better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2640, "output_token_count": 6090}

So neither trajectory has achieved the goal in that absolute sense.\n\nStep 2. Progress Toward the Sponge:\n• The target sponge is at approximately x = –0.109. In Trajectory 1 the robot starts at about x = 0.090 and by the third observation reaches about –0.111, getting very close to the target. Although later positions fluctuate, the trajectory does show a clear movement toward the sponge relative to its starting state.\n• In Trajectory 2 the robot begins around x = –2.01 and stays roughly near x ≈ –2 (only slowly moving to about –1.80 by the end), which is still very far from the target at –0.109. Thus, Trajectory 2 makes far less progress toward the sponge relative to its starting position.\n\nStep 3. Following Expert Actions:\n• For Trajectory 1, the expert’s suggested actions were [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] while the robot took [1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1].

{"full_text": "Step 1. Goal Achievement Comparison:\n• Both trajectories are incomplete – neither reached the sponge (success) nor collided.\n• When we compare progress toward the goal (taking into account that the segments begin at different starting positions), we see that the robot’s distance to the sponge changed differently:\n – In Trajectory 1 the robot started at about 1.12 m away from the sponge and ended about 1.25 m away.

However, even though some of the robot’s actions in Trajectory 1 match parts of the expert sequence, the overall progress metric (i.e. how much closer the robot got to the sponge from its starting point) is more favorable in Trajectory 2.\n• Neither trajectory is truncated or exhibits collision issues, so they are mainly differentiated by how much they advance toward the target and adherence to the expert actions (with progress and expert alignment weighted equally). Since Trajectory 2 shows positive progress toward reducing its distance while Trajectory 1’s distance has increased, Trajectory 2 is considered to be better achieving the goal.\n\nStep 2.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Success/Collision Check:\n• Both trajectories did not achieve success (reaching the sponge) and did not incur any collisions. Neither trajectory terminated nor was truncated. So both are on equal footing regarding the foremost priority.\n\nStep 2. Progress Evaluation:\n• For Trajectory 1, the starting pose is approximately (x ≈ –1.154, …, z ≈ 1.423) and the final pose is (x ≈ –1.136, …, z ≈ 1.528). When compared to the sponge’s position at (x ≈ –0.109, y ≈ 0.533, z ≈ 2.227), the distance from the start is about 1.42 m and that from the end is about 1.35 m. This shows a small improvement (i.e. a move of roughly 0.07 m closer to the sponge relative to the segment’s start).\n• For Trajectory 2, the robot starts at (x ≈ 0.040, …, z ≈ 1.243) so its initial distance from the sponge is roughly 1.125 m. However, by the end (x ≈ –0.669, …, z ≈ 1.238) its distance increases to about 1.250 m. Hence, relative progress in Trajectory 2 actually indicates a regression when comparing the end of the segment to its start.\n\nStep 3. Expert Actions Comparison:\n• In Trajectory 1 no expert actions were provided, so there is no basis to compare the robot’s actions to the expert’s.\n• In Trajectory 2, expert actions are provided and a rough comparison (by aligning the first several actions) shows that only about half the robot’s actions match the expert’s sequence. Although there is partial agreement here, the progress metric is an equally weighted consideration with following the expert, and a negative progress (moving away from the sponge) is concerning.\n\nFinal Analysis:\nPrioritizing success/collision first (both equal here), then giving equal weight to progress and matching expert actions, Trajectory 1 (despite no expert action comparison available) records positive progress toward the goal whereas Trajectory 2 shows a regression in progress even though it has some expert action agreement.

Success/Collision:  \n • Both trajectories show no success (no episode ends with reaching the sponge) and no collisions.  \n • Therefore, neither trajectory “solves” the task outright.\n\n2. Progress and Expert Agreement:  \n • Progress: We compare the relative distance reduction of the robot’s pose toward the sponge.  \n  – Trajectory 1 starts at approximately [–0.928, 0.009, 1.375] and ends at about [–0.664, 0.009, 1.418]. Compared to the sponge location [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227], the distance decreases by roughly 0.18 m.  \n  – Trajectory 2 starts at [0.081, 0.0097, –1.339] and ends at [–0.003, 0.0094, –1.251]; the corresponding distance reduction toward the sponge (located at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) is only around 0.09 m.  \n  Thus, Trajectory 1 makes roughly double the progress toward the goal.\n\n • Expert Actions Adherence:  \n  – For Trajectory 1 the expert‐action list is empty, so there is no explicit alignment to compare.  \n  – Trajectory 2 has an expert action sequence ([2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) while its own actions ([2,2,1,1,2,1,2,1,2,2]) match only the first step.  \n  This suggests that Trajectory 2 deviates considerably from the expert guidance.  \n\n3. Truncation:  \n • Neither trajectory shows truncation (both have fewer than 100 steps and the robot remains in bounds).\n\nPutting it all together:  \n– With no successful outcome or collision, the decisive factors are progress and expert action adherence.  \n– Trajectory 1 not only makes greater progress toward the sponge but also does not show any deviation issues (since there’s no expert discrepancy data, there is no penalty there).  \n– Trajectory 2 not only makes less progress but also deviates from the expert’s recommended actions.\n\nBased on these considerations, Trajectory 1 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2561, "output_token_count": 2313}

{"full_text": "Step 1. Success/Collision check:\n• Both trajectories have no success (never reached the sponge) and no collisions, and neither trajectory was truncated. So at this highest priority level, they are equivalent.\n\nStep 2. Progress and following the expert’s intended strategy:\n• For Trajectory 1, the robot’s starting position is about (–0.49, 0.009, 1.33) and the target sponge is approximately (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227). The ideal displacement vector points toward increases in x (from –0.49 toward –0.109), y, and z. However, the actual displacement in Trajectory 1 (from about (–0.49, 0.009, 1.33) to (–0.97, 0.009, 1.55)) shows that the robot moved in the wrong x‐direction (farther away from –0.109) and only a very small amount in the z direction. When projecting the movement onto the ideal direction, almost none of the motion contributes to progress toward the sponge.\n• Trajectory 2 starts at (1.810, 0.009, 0.986) while the target is still (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227). Although the initial distance is larger, the displacement observed (ending at approximately (1.275, 0.010, 1.005)) shows that a substantial component of the movement (especially a large shift in the x-coordinate from 1.81 to 1.275) aligns with the direction toward the sponge. A projection of this displacement on the ideal vector from its starting position indicates that a majority of the motion was effectively aimed toward the sponge.\n• Comparing the actual sequence of actions to the expert actions, neither trajectory closely follows the expert’s prescribed steps.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Reviewing the two trajectories, neither reached the sponge (no success) or hit an obstacle (no collision), and they are not truncated. This makes primary evaluation (success or collision) tied. Therefore we look at the secondary criteria: Progress toward the sponge and how closely the robot’s actions follow the expert’s actions.\n\nFor progress we can estimate the “distance-to-sponge” improvement within each segment. In Trajectory 1 the robot’s starting position is roughly (1.81, 0.009, 0.986) and ends near (1.275, 0.0096, 1.005) while the sponge is at about (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227). Although Trajectory 1’s starting point is far from the goal, the observed positions indicate a reduction in the distance (roughly a 0.4 m decrease), suggesting that the robot is making progress toward the goal from its starting point.\n\nIn Trajectory 2 the initial position is about (–0.491, 0.0087, 1.326) and the final one is roughly (–0.972, 0.0087, 1.550). With the goal fixed at (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227), the distance actually worsens slightly over the trajectory. Thus, in terms of progress relative to the starting configuration, Trajectory 1 shows a more favorable improvement.\n\nLooking at the expert actions, both trajectories have several deviations from their corresponding expert-provided action sequence. Although neither very closely mimics the expert actions – and both show several mismatches – the difference in following the expert actions is not as significant as the difference in progress.\n\nSince the highest priority after success/collision is to make progress toward the sponge, and Trajectory 1 evidences clearer progress while Trajectory 2 appears to drift away a bit, Trajectory 1 is judged as better at achieving the goal.\n\nStep 2.

{"full_text": "Step 1: Analyzing success/collision criteria  \n• In Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 there is no success (sponge grasp) or collision since all \"success\" flags are false and \"collision\" entries are 0.  \n• Since neither trajectory reached the sponge nor collided, we move to the secondary criterion: progress and following expert actions.\n\nStep 2: Evaluating progress  \n• The trajectory segments do not necessarily start from the same position. The expert note instructs us to measure how far the robot has moved toward the sponge relative to its starting position.  \n• In Trajectory 1, the robot’s starting position (by the first observation) is around (–0.019, 0.009). Its final position is about (–0.015, 0.009). Given that the sponge is at roughly (–0.109, 0.533), the distance from the robot to the sponge barely changes between the first and last observation (~0.532 meters away at both points), implying negligible progress.  \n• In Trajectory 2, the robot starts at (–1.589, 0.009) and ends at (–0.331, 0.009). Computing approximate Euclidean distances (ignoring the small y change) to the sponge (–0.109, 0.533): the initial distance is about 1.57 units and the final distance is about 0.57 units. This significant reduction indicates substantial progress toward the sponge.\n\nStep 3: Evaluating expert action adherence  \n• In Trajectory 1, the robot’s actions [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 1] differ considerably from the expert actions [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …].  \n• In Trajectory 2, the robot’s actions [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 2] also do not match the expert actions [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …] perfectly.  \n• While both trajectories do not follow the expert’s actions very closely, the significant difference in progress gives Trajectory 2 a clear edge.\n\nStep 4: Considering truncation  \n• Neither trajectory is marked as truncated. Thus, truncation does not play a role in the final decision.\n\nConclusion:  \nBoth Trajectories do not show completion (success) or collision; however, Trajectory 2 demonstrates significant progress moving closer to the sponge. Although the following-expert criterion is not strongly met by either trajectory, progress is equally weighted and Trajectory 2’s progress is much more substantial.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2732, "output_token_count": 2579}

Trajectory 1 shows significant progress toward the goal. Its starting x‐coordinate is around –1.59 and it ends at about –0.33, which is notably closer to the sponge’s x position (approximately –0.11).

Trajectory 1 at least shows progress toward the goal and seems to be more consistent with a direct approach (improving its distance to the sponge).\n\nConclusion:\nConsidering the priorities in order (avoiding collisions/failure, making progress, and then following expert action), Trajectory 1 is better in achieving the goal because it makes positive progress toward the sponge while Trajectory 2 moves slightly away from it.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2556, "output_token_count": 2937}

{"full_text": "Step 1: Check for terminal achievement (success or collision)  \n• In both trajectory segments, no termination has occurred (success is false; no collisions). Hence on the highest‐priority criterion (task completion via success/collision), neither is clearly better.\n\nStep 2: Evaluate progress and adherence to expert actions  \n• Progress:  \n – In Trajectory 1, if we compute the Euclidean distance from the robot’s starting position (≈[–1.75, …, –1.27]) to the sponge (≈[–0.11, 0.533, 2.227]) and then from its end position (≈[–1.25, …, –1.20]) to the sponge, we see that the distance has reduced (from roughly 3.90 m to 3.65 m). This shows some progress toward the goal.  \n – In Trajectory 2, the starting position (≈[–0.46, …, 1.36]) is already much closer to the goal (≈1.07 m away), but its end position (≈[–0.96, …, 1.50]) is actually a bit further (≈1.24 m away). So relative to its own starting position, Trajectory 2 has moved away from the sponge.  \n\n• Following expert actions:  \n – Although neither trajectory exactly mimics the expert, examining their respective sequences shows that Trajectory 1, despite several mismatches compared to the long expert sequence, is at least driving modest progress toward the goal.  \n – Trajectory 2 displays several deviations from its expert action set as well, and combined with the regression in physical progress, its action deviations are more concerning.\n\nStep 3: Consider truncation  \n• Neither trajectory is truncated.  \n\nOverall, because both trajectories are ongoing and have no terminal events, the second priority – progress toward and the manner of following expert guidance – becomes pivotal. Trajectory 1 shows some improvement (closer by about 0.25 m in distance), while Trajectory 2 appears to back away from the goal despite starting closer.

However, both trajectories show significant deviations from the expert sequences.  \n• In Trajectory 1, only the first action (and the last couple of zeros) align with the expert’s recommendations.  \n• In Trajectory 2, there is also only limited agreement, although its overall actions sequence (characterized by some turns and forward moves) might be interpreted as an attempt to reorient toward progress.  \n• Because following expert actions is weighted equally with progress and neither trajectory perfectly mimics the expert sequence, the distinguishing factor here is the progress metric.  \n\nStep 4 – Truncation Check:  \n• Neither trajectory terminated via truncation; both segments are ongoing with no truncation.  \n\nConclusion:  \n• With no episode termination differences and similar performance regarding collisions/success, the main difference becomes progress toward the goal.  \n• Trajectory 2 demonstrates positive displacement (progress) toward the sponge relative to its starting position, whereas Trajectory 1 essentially failed to make effective progress.  \n• Therefore, under the given priorities, Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2632, "output_token_count": 2833}

For this trajectory, the distance to the sponge decreases significantly (from roughly 2.07 meters to about 1.26 meters, an improvement of around 0.81 meters).\n\nThus, although neither trajectory achieves success, Trajectory 2 shows a more significant progress toward the goal.\n\nStep 2: Based on the analysis, the goal is better achieved in Trajectory 2.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2507, "output_token_count": 2097}

{"full_text": "Step 1. Evaluating the “goal” of approaching the sponge:\n • In both trajectories the episode is still ongoing (no success, no collision, no truncation) so we must compare “progress” toward the sponge and (where available) how well the actions match expert suggestions.\n • Looking at progress, we use the first three numbers of each observation as the robot’s position and compare the Euclidean distance to the sponge ([–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]).  \n  – For Trajectory 1, the start position is approximately [–1.177, 0.009, 1.470] giving an initial distance ≈ 1.41 m. The final position is about [–1.063, 0.009, 1.580] with a distance ≈ 1.27 m.

Progress and Following Expert Actions:  \n• We first check progress toward the sponge. Using the starting and ending positions relative to the sponge’s position, we see that:  \n – Trajectory 1 started at about [–1.82, 0.009, 2.20] and ended at about [–1.69, 0.009, 2.42].

This yields an improvement of roughly 0.14 m and leaves it about 1.27 m from the sponge (versus about 1.68 m for Trajectory 1).

Overall Evaluation:  \n• Both trajectories are incomplete (so truncation is not a factor) and share no collisions or successes.  \n• While Trajectory 2 clearly makes more progress toward the sponge (and ends closer to it), its robot actions do not align well with the expert suggestions. On the other hand, Trajectory 1—though not compared against an expert pattern—shows slightly less progress.  \n• Since the primary (collision/success) criterion is equal and the two secondary criteria are weighted equally, the slight edge in progress (i.e. being closer to the sponge) makes Trajectory 2 the better candidate for achieving the goal despite poor expert action matching.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2558, "output_token_count": 4148}

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the two segments step by step:\n\n–––––––– Step 1: Success/Collision – (Highest Priority)\n\nBoth trajectories end the episode (terminated = true) at the last step. However, the collision flag shows that in each case the final step experienced a collision (collision value 1 on the final step), and neither trajectory registered a success. Thus, from the success/collision viewpoint, both trajectories fail equally (they both ended in collision).\n\n–––––––– Step 2: Progress and Following the Expert’s Actions\n\nBecause neither trajectory succeeded, we compare how well the robot made progress and how closely it followed expert behavior.\n\n• Progress Along the Trajectory:\n – In Trajectory 1 the starting position is about (–1.91, 0.01, –0.88) and the final position is around (–1.05, 0.01, –0.57). Comparing these relative to the sponge’s position (approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]), Trajectory 1 shows a reduction in distance of roughly 0.63 units.\n – In Trajectory 2 the start is about (–0.378, 0.01, –0.886) and the end is roughly (–0.470, 0.009, –0.621), which is only about a 0.25 unit improvement.\nThus, although both hit a collision, Trajectory 1 made more progress toward the target relative to its starting point.\n\n• Matching Expert Actions:\n – The expert actions for Trajectory 1 are mostly “move forward” (action 0) with a turn appearing after about 10 steps; the robot’s sequence starts with two forwards but then begins to deviate (actions 2 and 1) before returning to forward motions.\n – For Trajectory 2 the expert action starts with a 2 then follows with zeros, yet the robot consistently executes left turns (action 1) for the first four steps before mixing in a few forwards. This is a larger deviation from what the expert suggested.\nWhile neither trajectory exactly follows the expert, Trajectory 1 more closely adheres to a forward-moving pattern (which is what the expert predominantly recommends) than Trajectory 2.\n\n–––––––– Step 3: Truncation\nNeither trajectory was truncated (the “truncated” flag is false in both cases), so that does not provide a differentiator.\n\n–––––––– Final Analysis\n\n• Both trajectories ended with a collision – the worst primary outcome.\n• Under a collision outcome, we compare progress and matching expert actions.\n – Trajectory 1 achieves better progress toward the sponge (a greater reduction in distance relative to its starting point) and it generally follows the expert’s “forward” advice more closely than Trajectory 2.\nThus, despite both trajectories being unsuccessful overall (due to the collision), Trajectory 1 is slightly better in terms of second-level criteria (progress and expert guidance).\n\n–––––––– Final Answer Format\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2642, "output_token_count": 2354}
{"full_text": "I'll break down the evaluation step by step:\n\n1. Success/Collision Check:\n • Both trajectories terminated with a collision (collision flag is 1 in the final step and success remained false). So neither managed to “successfully” reach the sponge – a critical failure.\n\n2. Progress Toward the Sponge:\n • Trajectory 1 started relatively close to the sponge (its first x,y was about [–0.378, 0.0096] while the sponge is at about [–0.109, 0.533]). However, by the end of the segment the robot’s position was around [–0.470, 0.0091], which is actually slightly farther from the sponge.\n • Trajectory 2, on the other hand, started farther away (roughly [–1.911, 0.0096]) and ended near [–1.052, 0.0088]. This shows a considerable reduction in the distance to the target – a healthy progress toward the sponge relative to its own starting position.\n\n3. Matching Expert Actions:\n • In Trajectory 1, the robot predominantly executed left turns (action 1), whereas the expert recommended mostly moving forward (action 0) with a turn only at the beginning. This divergence suggests that Trajectory 1 did not follow the expert’s strategy.\n • Trajectory 2 shows more alignment with expert actions. Its first two actions (0, 0) match the expert’s sequence, and several of the later actions (steps 6–10 are 0) also align with the expert. Although there are some discrepancies in the middle, overall it is closer to an expert plan.\n\n4. Truncation:\n • Neither trajectory was truncated, so that criterion does not affect the evaluation here.\n\nConclusion:\nBoth trajectories ended in collision (a top-priority failure), but comparing progress and adherence to expert behavior, Trajectory 2 showed clear improvement toward the target and a better match to the expert’s recommended actions.\n\nThus, even though both have the same primary error (collision), Trajectory 2 better achieves the intended goal in terms of progress and following expert actions.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2642, "output_token_count": 2309}

{"full_text": "Step 1 – Goal‐Achievement Check:\n• Neither trajectory ended with a success (i.e. reaching the sponge) and neither experienced a collision. (There was also no truncation.) So at the highest–priority level, both are equivalent.\n\nStep 2 – Progress (Relative Movement) Analysis:\n• The intended “progress” is measured relative to the starting position. In Trajectory 1 the robot started about 3.6 m away from the sponge and ended about 3.8 m away – a regression of roughly 0.20 m (about a 5–6% worsening).\n• In Trajectory 2 the robot started only about 1.03 m away from the sponge but ended approximately 1.21 m away – a regression of about 0.18 m, which is nearly a 17–18% worsening relative to its starting gap.\nThus, relative to their starting positions, Trajectory 1 “lost” less progress than Trajectory 2.\n\nStep 3 – Conformity with Expert Actions:\n• For Trajectory 1 an expert action list is provided. A position–by–position comparison shows that very few (only 1 of 10) actions match the expert suggestion.\n• For Trajectory 2 no expert action information is provided, so we cannot compare on that dimension.\nSince “progress” and “following expert actions” are to be weighted equally, Trajectory 1’s poor match with expert guidance is a downside. However, when considering both these factors, the progress aspect weighs in strongly because the evaluation is meant to consider how well the robot moves (relative to its starting situation) toward the sponge.\n\nConclusion:\nBoth trajectories did not achieve the goal (no success), but Trajectory 1 maintained its relative approach better (only a small worsening relative to its start) while Trajectory 2, although it started closer, regressed proportionally more. Even though Trajectory 1 did not follow the expert’s actions well, overall—when considering all prioritized factors (success/collision first, then progress plus expert agreement)—Trajectory 1 appears to be in a slightly better position regarding “achieving the goal.”\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2611, "output_token_count": 5511}
{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evidence step by step:\n\n1. Goal achievement first evaluates whether the robot reached the sponge or hit an obstacle. In both trajectories no episode‐end event has occurred (no success and no collision), so neither “completed” nor “failed” in that primary sense.\n\n2. The next priority is progress and following the expert’s actions. Because the segments may start at very different locations, we look at relative movement toward the goal. Here the “goal” (sponge) is at approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. In Trajectory 1 the robot starts about 1.03 meters away (by a Euclidean estimate) and ends about 1.21 meters away; the movement (when projected along the direction from its starting position to the sponge) shows only a very small negative progress. In contrast, Trajectory 2 starts from a position roughly 3.6 meters from the sponge and ends at about 3.8 meters away with a displacement vector that, when compared with the “to-goal” vector, indicates a larger movement away from the sponge.\n\nAlso note that Trajectory 2 comes with a long expert action sequence. (Trajectory 1 has no expert actions provided.) When one compares the robot’s actions in Trajectory 2 against the expert’s actions, there are several mismatches – for example, at the very first step the expert would take action 2 while the robot took 0, and subsequent actions further differ. This further penalizes Trajectory 2’s quality on the progress-and-alignment criterion.\n\n3. Finally, neither episode was truncated, so that factor does not affect the comparison.\n\nOverall, because neither trajectory achieved success (or encountered a collision) and both did not complete the episode, our main evaluation hinges on progress toward the goal and adherence to the expert’s behavior. The analysis suggests that Trajectory 1 makes less “negative progress” (its displacement roughly “stays in place” relative to the sponge) whereas Trajectory 2 shows a larger movement away from the goal and deviates more from the expert’s intended actions.\n\nThus, trajectory 1 appears to be the better of the two with respect to achieving the intended goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2611, "output_token_count": 2961}

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation using your three priorities:\n\n1. Success/collision:  \n • Both segments have no collision and no success (the “success” flag is false in every step). So neither trajectory has “succeeded” in reaching the sponge or “failed” by colliding.  \n\n2. Progress and following expert actions (equal weight):  \n A. Progress toward the sponge is measured relative to each segment’s starting point.  \n  – In Trajectory 1 the robot started about 1.22 m (roughly computed) from the sponge. At one intermediate step it appears to get a bit closer (around 1.18 m), but the final position is about 1.33 m away. That shows that although the robot made some progress mid‐trajectory, by the end it has actually ended farther from the sponge than its original starting point.  \n  – In Trajectory 2 the robot started at about 1.24 m and ended around 1.24 m (very nearly the same distance). Its progress is more “steady” in that it does not end up noticeably further away from the sponge.  \n B. Trajectory adherence to expert actions:  \n  – Expert Actions 1 (for Trajectory 1) call for mostly forward moves at first then turns; a comparison shows that Trajectory 1’s actions only match the expert commands in about 2 out of the 7 available steps.  \n  – Expert Actions 2 (for Trajectory 2) suggest mostly moving forward (with one twist) and when comparing with Trajectory 2’s 10 actions, there are about 4 steps where the robot’s actions match the expert’s recommendation.  \n Thus, Trajectory 2 not only shows a steadier (less regressive) progress toward the sponge overall but also has slightly better correspondence with the expert actions.  \n\n3. Truncation:  \n • Neither trajectory is truncated.\n\nStep‑by‑step, neither trajectory achieved success (or hit obstacles), so we must decide based on progress and expert action adherence. Trajectory 1 made some intermittent progress but ended up farther from the sponge than it started, and its action sequence deviates more from the expert’s recommendations.

{"full_text": "Below is our step‐by‐step evaluation:\n\n1. Both trajectories have no success (no “success” flag turned true) and no collision. Therefore, neither reached the sponge nor hit an obstacle. In that sense the “first priority” is equally satisfied (or rather not “failed”) in both.\n\nNext, we examine the progress metric. Although the two segments start at different positions, we compare the improvement in Euclidean distance toward the known sponge location. For Trajectory 1 the robot went from about 3.59 m away (from its starting pose) to about 3.50 m away by its end—a 0.09 m improvement. For Trajectory 2 the starting distance was roughly 4.15 m and the final distance was about 3.96 m – a reduction of about 0.19 m. In other words, relative to its starting pose Trajectory 2 made nearly double the progress.\n\nThen we check how well the trajectories followed the expert’s intended actions. Although neither sequence exactly matches the expert (when comparing the 10-step action sequence available in each segment to the corresponding expert-action sequence), both can be seen to deviate in several places. Thus, the match to the expert’s actions is comparable between the two so that the progress metric becomes the deciding factor.\n\nFinally, no truncation occurred in either segment, so that does not influence the comparison.\n\nPutting it all together—since both trajectories avoid collisions and none reached the goal, the next two criteria (progress and expert match, each weighted equally) tip the balance. Here, Trajectory 2 shows greater progress while maintaining a comparable alignment with the expert actions.\n\n2. Hence, based on the above, the goal is better achieved in Trajectory 2.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2677, "output_token_count": 3054}
{"full_text": "Step 1. Outcome (Success/Collision/Truncation):\n• In both trajectory segments the robot neither reached the sponge (success remains false) nor collided, and neither was truncated – so the most critical condition is equally unmet.\n\nStep 2. Progress Toward the Sponge:\n• For Trajectory 1 the robot’s starting (x,y) position is about (0.343, 0.0098) and the final (x,y) about (–0.214, 0.0087). With the sponge located at (–0.109, 0.533), the Euclidean distances (ignoring the z‐component) go from roughly 0.69 m at start to about 0.54 m at the end – an improvement of ≈0.15 m.\n• In Trajectory 2 the initial (x,y) is near (–1.046, 0.0093) and the final about (–0.605, 0.0088). Computing the distances to the sponge gives roughly 1.07 m initially and about 0.72 m finally – an improvement of ≈0.35 m.\n• Hence Trajectory 2 shows a significantly larger progress toward the sponge relative to its own starting location.\n\nStep 3. Alignment With Expert Actions:\n• Comparing the robot’s actions with the expert’s actions:\n  – In Trajectory 1, out of the first 10 steps, roughly 3 actions match the expert sequence.\n  – In Trajectory 2, about 2 of the first 10 actions align with the expert.\n• Thus, Trajectory 1 seems marginally closer to the expert actions.\n\nStep 4. Overall Evaluation:\n• Since the success/collision outcome is identical for both, the next priorities are progress and expert action imitation (given equal weight).\n• While Trajectory 1 has a slight edge in matching expert actions, Trajectory 2 clearly outperforms in progress—making much greater headway toward the target sponge.\n• With equal weighting on progress and following the expert, the larger progress in Trajectory 2 outweighs the small difference in expert-action match.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2677, "output_token_count": 2883}

{"full_text": "Let’s break down our evaluation in light of the three priorities.\n\n1. Success/collision:\n • In both segments the “success” flags are false and no collisions occurred. So neither has achieved grasping the sponge or “failed” by collision.\n\n2. Progress (and alignment to expert actions):\n • While we must consider both how much the robot has moved “toward” the sponge relative to its starting point and how closely its actions resemble the expert’s, the two trajectories begin at different locations. Trajectory 1 starts much farther from the sponge (distance ≃ 3.6 units from the target) than Trajectory 2 (distance ≃ 1.0 unit away). However, what matters for progress is not the absolute distance but the change relative to the segment start.\n  – In Trajectory 1 the change in the robot’s position shows a slight improvement: the final “distance” (as estimated from the starting pose and the goal) decreases a little (from roughly 3.61 to 3.52).\n  – In Trajectory 2, despite starting closer to the sponge, the relative movement in the given steps made the robot “worse” in terms of the progress toward the target (going from about 1.02 to 1.13).\n • Next, comparing how well the trajectories follow the expert actions:\n  – For Trajectory 1, with 10 robot actions compared against an expert sequence of 11 (for the corresponding steps) there is only one step where the action matches (the first action: 2 vs 2), giving roughly 10% agreement.\n  – For Trajectory 2, comparing the first 5 actions to the expert’s 5 shows 1 match (the third action) – a 20% match.\n • Though Trajectory 2 shows a slightly higher fractional similarity with the expert’s recommended actions, its progress in terms of moving toward the sponge is negative over the segment (i.e. it seems to “back away”), whereas Trajectory 1, though it follows the expert only sparingly, makes a small gain in progress.\n\n3. Truncation:\n • Neither segment was truncated.\n\nGiven that success/collision is a hard priority (and both are equal on that) and that progress (the relative improvement toward the target) is as important as following the expert actions, the fact that Trajectory 1 makes actual forward progress while Trajectory 2 even “regresses” relative to its starting point makes Trajectory 1 more promising in achieving the goal.\n\nTherefore, when considering all factors, Trajectory 1 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2583, "output_token_count": 3560}

In that sense both are ongoing, but we then look at the next priorities.\n\n• Progress toward the sponge:\n – For Trajectory 1, if you compare the starting position (around [–0.474, 0.0096, 1.428]) and the ending position (around [–0.753, 0.0092, 1.460]), the displacement vector (–0.279, roughly 0, +0.031) projects negatively onto the vector pointing from its start to the sponge ([0.365, 0.523, 0.799]). This indicates that the robot actually moved slightly in the opposite direction of the sponge.\n – For Trajectory 2, the starting position ([0.081, 0.0097, –1.3393]) and the ending position ([–0.0030, 0.0094, –1.2513]) yield a displacement (about –0.081, 0, +0.088) that projects positively on the corresponding “to-sponge” direction. Even though progress is modest, it is in the right direction.\n\n• Following expert actions:\n – For Trajectory 1, the expert’s set of five actions [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] has little in common with the first five robot actions [1, 2, 1, 0, 2] (only the third action matches).\n – For Trajectory 2, although only the first action (2) agrees with the provided expert sequence ([2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]), the expert guidance here appears geared toward “going straight” (action 0) after the initial 2. Despite lower alignment in the expert actions, the crucial difference is that Trajectory 2 makes positive progress toward the sponge while Trajectory 1 drifts away.\n\n• Truncation is not an issue for either trajectory.\n\nBecause the primary goal is to reach the sponge (or at least making consistent progress toward it) and none has reached it, the ability to move in the correct direction is the key differentiator.

The first action is in accordance with the expert, though the second and third differ.  \n• Trajectory 2’s expert actions (a longer sequence mostly consisting of 0’s with a 2 in the beginning) compared to actual actions [2, 2, 0, …] show that while the very first action matches, the subsequent actions deviate more.  \n\nStep 3 – Consideration of Truncation:  \nBoth trajectories are equally not truncated.\n\nStep 4 – Making the Overall Judgment:  \nWith neither trajectory achieving success/collision termination, we compare progress and expert matching.

For progress, we look at whether the robot’s distance from the sponge improves relative to the start of the segment.\n• In Trajectory 1, the starting position is approximately [–0.454, 0.009, 1.306] and the ending position is roughly [–0.524, 0.009, 1.321]. The computed Euclidean distances to the sponge show that from start to end the distance did not decrease—in fact, it increased slightly.\n• In Trajectory 2, the start is about [–0.184, 0.009, 1.057] and the end is roughly [0.013, 0.010, 1.154]. Here, a calculation shows that the distance to the sponge decreased (from about 1.28 m to roughly 1.20 m), indicating that the robot has made measurable progress in moving toward the goal.\n\nStep 3: Comparing alignment with expert actions\n• In Trajectory 1, the provided expert action sequence (Expert Actions 1) is [2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0] while the robot took [2,2,0,1,1,2,1,0,1,1]. There is a match on the first action and a few later similarities, but several differences are present.\n• In Trajectory 2, the expert action sequence (Expert Actions 2) is [1,1,0]. Comparing the first few actions from Trajectory 2 ([1,2,1, …]) with the expert actions, the first action is a match. While the subsequent actions are not an exact match, given that progress and expert adherence are weighted equally, the slight deviation does not outweigh the evident progress made.\n\nStep 4: Considering truncation\n• Neither trajectory segment is truncated, so this factor does not affect the final evaluation.\n\nConclusion:\nNeither trajectory achieved success nor collided. However, Trajectory 2 shows measurable progress toward the sponge (distance reduction from start to finish) while Trajectory 1 did not, even though both trajectories have imperfect alignment with expert actions. With progress being equally weighted with following expert actions, the positive progress in Trajectory 2 makes it the better candidate.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2571, "output_token_count": 2611}

In Trajectory 1 the robot’s distance to the sponge improved from roughly 3.67 m to about 3.64 m – a very modest improvement. In Trajectory 2 the improvement was from about 3.45 m to 3.37 m – a slightly larger progress given its more significant change in the crucial direction (for example, the robot’s x-coordinate moved notably closer to the sponge’s x-location). \n• Following Expert Actions: The expert’s actions are almost all forward moves initially. Trajectory 2 started with a forward action (action 0) matching the expert’s prescription, whereas Trajectory 1 started with a turning action (action 2) that does not align with the expert’s forward-driving guidance.

While its z‐coordinate increased, its x-coordinate moved in the opposite direction from the sponge (which requires moving toward higher x values to reach –0.109). In fact, a projection of its motion onto the “sponge‐direction” shows a negative contribution, meaning the robot moved away from the sponge relative to where it started.\n\nStep 3 – Alignment With Expert Actions:  \n• For Trajectory 1, the expert’s actions ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]) mostly call for moving forward, with a turn at the end. The robot followed mostly the same actions initially ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) before deviating slightly in the latter steps.  \n• For Trajectory 2, the expert provided only a single action ([0]), whereas the robot’s sequence has several turns.

Although it makes some progress toward the sponge, the collision is a major failure.\n – Trajectory 2 does not record any collision and remains ongoing (no termination, no collision, not truncated). Avoiding collision is the top priority.\n\n• Progress and Conformance to Expert Actions:\n – In Trajectory 1, the robot makes a significant displacement relative to its starting point toward the sponge. However, the progress is moot given that a collision occurred, which is highly detrimental.\n – In Trajectory 2, when comparing the start and latest position, the robot moved only slightly closer to the sponge. Also, the sequence of actions taken deviates from the expert's provided actions. Nonetheless, since progress and following expert cues come second in priority, the absence of collision remains more important.\n\n• Truncation:\n – Neither trajectory is truncated by the given conditions.\n\nOverall, despite Trajectory 1 showing more displacement toward the goal, its collision (a major issue that takes precedence) makes it far less desirable.

Since collision is highly undesirable, this is a major drawback.\n\nStep 2 – Compare progress and expert action alignment:  \n• Although Trajectory 1 is incomplete, its progress data (based on positions relative to the sponge) shows slight improvement without risking collision. Also, its action sequence begins with the expert’s recommended action (0), which lends it some alignment with the expert demonstration.  \n• Trajectory 2 does show some progress toward the sponge (a reduction in Euclidean distance from its starting point), but its action sequence deviates from the expert’s suggestion (it begins with action 2 rather than the expert’s action 0) and ultimately results in a collision, severely undermining its progress.\n\nStep 3 – Overall Evaluation considering all priorities:  \n• Priority one (goal outcome): Trajectory 2 ends in collision, a highly undesirable outcome. Even if there is some progress, the collision outweighs any improvement. Trajectory 1, though incomplete, avoids collision, keeping the option open for reaching the goal.  \n• Priority two (progress and adherence to expert actions): Trajectory 1 shows better initial alignment (starting with the expert’s recommended action) and avoids missteps that lead to collision.  \n• Priority three (truncation): Neither trajectory is truncated, so this factor does not change the assessment.\n\nConclusion:  \nThere is a significant difference; Trajectory 1 is preferable because it avoids the detrimental collision seen in Trajectory 2, even if its progress toward the goal is not complete.  \n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2533, "output_token_count": 1886}

Although not dramatic, this segment shows that the robot’s distance to the sponge is reduced very slightly (from roughly 1.245 m down to about 1.198 m in 3D Euclidean distance).\n – Trajectory 2: The robot begins around [–0.778, 0.009, 1.822] and finishes near [–0.953, 0.009, 2.042]. In this case, the computed distance actually increases slightly (from roughly 0.941 m to about 1.010 m).\nThus, relative to its own starting point, Trajectory 1 makes marginal progress towards the sponge while Trajectory 2 ends up being a bit farther away.\n\nStep 3. Comparing to expert actions:\n• For Trajectory 1 the expert actions provided are [0, 0, 1, 1, 0] while the robot’s actions are a 10‐step sequence [1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0]. Comparing the early steps, there are several mismatches.\n• In Trajectory 2 the expert actions are [1, 0] and the robot’s first two actions are [0, 0]. Here also there is at least one mismatch.\nNeither trajectory follows the expert actions very faithfully when only a short initial segment is compared. With expert conformance weighted equally with progress, the slight advantage on progress for Trajectory 1 becomes notable.\n\nStep 4. Overall evaluation:\n• Since neither trajectory had any termination events (neither success nor collision), we look at progress and expert conformity. Trajectory 1 shows a slight positive progress toward the sponge while Trajectory 2 appears to move away from the target.\n• Although neither trajectory closely follows the expert actions, the progress factor (which is as important as matching actions) favors Trajectory 1.\n\nFinal Answer:\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2537, "output_token_count": 3269}

Therefore, we must decide based on the secondary criteria: progress toward the sponge (taking into account the relative motion from the starting positions) and how closely the robot’s actions match the expert‐provided actions.\n\n• In Trajectory 1 the robot starts at a pose whose Euclidean distance (roughly computed) from the sponge is about 0.94 m. At the end of the segment the distance is about 1.01 m, meaning that overall the robot has moved away (in at least one dimension) from the sponge relative to its starting location.\n\n• In Trajectory 2 the robot starts further away (≈1.24 m) but ends a little closer (≈1.20 m), showing at least a small improvement in getting closer to the sponge.\n\n• Both trajectories use action sequences that are not an ideal match to the expert’s actions; however, since the progress (our secondary criterion) counts equally with following expert actions (and the agent never collided or completed the goal), the fact that Trajectory 2 shows even slight progress toward the sponge gives it an advantage.\n\n2.

{"full_text": "Let’s analyze the information step‐by‐step.\n\n1. Both trajectories do not result in success (no reaching the sponge) and do not have any collision. However, the next two priorities (progress and following expert actions) and the final one (truncation) help differentiate them.\n\n• Progress (and relative movement toward the sponge):\n  – Trajectory 1 starts with a robot position roughly at (–0.84, 0.009, –1.10) while the sponge is at about (–0.11, 0.533, 2.227). Although the absolute distance is large, what matters is how much the robot improves relative to its own starting point. In Trajectory 1 the distance to the sponge is reduced from roughly 3.45 m to about 3.37 m (an improvement of ≈0.08 m). Thus, even if the improvement is modest, it is in the right direction.\n  – Trajectory 2 starts much closer – about 0.93 m away from the sponge (using its own starting position around (–0.79, 0.010, 2.59)). Although it shows initial improvement (down to around 0.78 m a couple steps in), by the end of the segment the distance worsens a bit (back to about 0.96 m). This shows that even though it started close, the motion does not consistently progress toward the goal.\n\n• Following the expert’s actions:\n  – In Trajectory 1 the expert’s recommended actions are mostly “forward” (action 0), but the robot acts with many turns. This mismatch indicates deviation from the expert’s “best‐practice” even if the robot did some forward movement.\n  – In Trajectory 2 the expert actions are similarly forward with a couple of turns later on. Again, the robot’s actions (a mix of left, forward, and right turns) do not strongly match the expert’s prescribed pattern. So both trajectories are not very aligned with the experts; however, the inconsistent progress in Trajectory 2 is more concerning.\n\n• Truncation:\n  – Trajectory 2 ends with a truncation flag (due to too many steps or wandering off), which is a negative mark.\n  – Trajectory 1 is ongoing (no truncation) even though not successful.\n\nOverall, neither trajectory completes the goal. But in terms of priorities:\n • Neither reached success or experienced collision.\n • Trajectory 1 shows a small consistent progress toward the goal, while Trajectory 2 – despite starting closer – does not maintain its progress (and even regresses) and suffers a truncation penalty.\n • Both deviate from expert actions but T2’s pattern combined with its truncation makes it less desirable.\n\nThus, Trajectory 1 is the better candidate for achieving the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2642, "output_token_count": 3667}

Success/Collision:  \n • In both trajectories none of the steps show success (reaching the sponge) and there are no collisions.  \n • So neither trajectory “succeeds” nor “crashes” – we move on to the next criteria.\n\n2. Progress toward the sponge and expert‐action alignment (equal weight):  \n • Progress is judged relative to the starting position in the segment. For Trajectory 1 the (x,y) position starts at roughly (–0.79, 0.01) and ends at about (–0.70, 0.01) while the goal lies at roughly (–0.11, 0.53). This represents only a small movement toward the goal (an advance of about 0.095 m in the “goal direction” relative to an overall direct distance of ~0.86 m ≈ 9% progress).  \n • Trajectory 2, on the other hand, starts at (–0.84, 0.009) and ends at around (–0.55, 0.009). Relative to its starting point to the goal (from roughly (–0.84, 0.009) to (–0.11, 0.533)) this segment shows a displacement of ~0.29 m, which, when normalized to the approximately 0.9 m direct distance, amounts to roughly 32% progress.  \n • Looking at matching with expert actions, Trajectory 1’s executed actions (comparing the first 8 actions available) have a higher match rate with the expert (about 37.5% matches) compared to Trajectory 2 (about 20% match in the corresponding steps).  \n • When weighing these together equally, Trajectory 2’s much larger progress partially outweighs its lower expert-action alignment relative to Trajectory 1.\n\n3. Truncation:  \n • Trajectory 1 ends with a truncated flag, whereas Trajectory 2 does not show truncation. Truncation is a negative factor (albeit lower priority than progress and expert matching). This further penalizes Trajectory 1.\n\nPutting it all together:  \n– Although Trajectory 1 has slightly better action alignment with the expert, its very limited progress toward the sponge and the fact that its episode became truncated make it less desirable.  \n– Trajectory 2 shows significantly more progress toward the goal and isn’t truncated, even though its actions deviate more from the expert.  \n\nThus, overall the goal (reaching toward the sponge) is better achieved in Trajectory 2.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2642, "output_token_count": 4276}

Although neither trajectory followed the expert perfectly (and both end in collision), when we compare the sequences, Trajectory 2 begins with an action (2) matching the expert recommendation and generally shows a pattern that is somewhat aligned with making steady forward progress.\n• Trajectory 1 starts with action 2 while its expert pattern for that segment was [1, 1, 0, 0], and its overall sequence is less consistent with the expert’s progression.\n\nStep 4 – Overall Evaluation:\n\n• Both trajectories end in a collision (most detrimental factor), but Trajectory 2 makes better progress towards the sponge (closer final distance relative to its starting point) and shows closer initial adherence to expert-recommended actions.\n• Given that all factors are considered and weighted, Trajectory 2 is deemed to better achieve the goal when compared under the provided priorities.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2574, "output_token_count": 2303}

Progress Evaluation:\n• For Trajectory 1, the robot’s starting position is about (–0.912, 0.009, 1.534) and its final position is about (–0.508, 0.009, 1.580). Compared with the sponge’s position (approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]), the robot in Trajectory 1 reduces its distance to the target (for example, reducing the x–difference and slightly increasing its z–coordinate), indicating positive progress.\n• For Trajectory 2, the starting position is approximately (0.379, 0.009, –1.575) and the final position (0.269, 0.009, –1.857).

This shows that Trajectory 2 is moving away from the goal.\n\nStep 3. Action Comparison with Expert:\n• In Trajectory 1, the actions start with a “turn left” (1), which matches the expert’s initial action. While there are differences later in the sequence, the overall progression (and the fact that the robot was moving closer to the sponge) supports following the expert intent.\n• In Trajectory 2, the robot’s action sequence does not align as well with the provided expert guidance (the expert’s leading action is “move forward” (0) whereas the robot instead starts with a left turn) and the robot does not show improvement toward the target.\n\nStep 4.

{"full_text": "Step 1 – Evaluation of Goal Achievement:\n\n• Success/collision: Neither trajectory terminated in success (reaching the sponge) nor had any collisions. So based on the most important criteria there is no difference.\n\n• Progress: The evaluation must consider how far the robot moved toward the sponge relative to its starting position. For Trajectory 1, the robot’s positions changed only marginally (e.g. from about 1.60 m to 1.51 m away from the sponge, roughly a 0.09‐m improvement). In Trajectory 2, however, the robot started much farther from the sponge (nearly 3.79 m away) and ended around 3.59 m away – showing an improvement closer to 0.20 m. In relative terms, Trajectory 2 exhibits a greater progress toward the objective.\n\n• Expert action alignment: When comparing the chosen actions to those recommended by experts the robot in Trajectory 1 took a consistent action (mostly “2” indicating a right turn) while the expert expected mostly “0” (moving forward). In Trajectory 2, even though the provided “expert actions” list is shorter and only covers a few steps, comparing the beginning actions shows that the robot deviated from the expert’s early suggestion as well. Both trajectories are not well aligned with expert actions; however, since progress counts equally and trajectory 2 shows comparatively more forward progress, this factor tips the scale.\n\nSince neither trajectory has achieved the goal through success, and no collision or truncation issues are present, the overall evaluation must rely on the progress toward the sponge and how closely the expert actions were followed.

The initial action in Trajectory 1 does not match and subsequent actions show further divergence.\n• For Trajectory 2, the expert actions are [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] versus the performed sequence [2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1]. There are a couple of matches (e.g. the second and the seventh steps) but overall many differences.\n• In both cases the alignment with expert recommendations is not excellent, but because progress and following expert actions are weighted equally, the better improvement in progress is a notable advantage.\n\nStep 4: Consider Truncation\n• Neither trajectory is truncated, so this factor does not differentiate between them.\n\nConclusion:\n• Since neither segment ended with success or collision, progress and expert-action similarity become critical.\n• Trajectory 1 shows notably more progress toward the sponge, even though neither follows the expert’s actions very well.\n• Thus, overall, Trajectory 1 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2558, "output_token_count": 2680}

Trajectory 1 starts very far from that (its initial position is about (–0.884, 0.009, –1.63)) and ends roughly at (–0.816, 0.009, –1.84).

{"full_text": "Step 1. Check for episode termination events (success/collision):  \n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 there are no termination events (no success reached, no collision happened, and no truncation). This means that neither segment has “completed” the goal, so we move on to the next criteria.\n\nStep 2. Examine progress (how much closer the robot got toward the sponge relative to its own starting point):  \n• For Trajectory 1, using the robot’s 3D position the Euclidean distance from its starting point ([1.75, 0.009, –1.494]) to the sponge ([-0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) is roughly 4.19 m. At the end of the segment ([0.40668, 0.00905, –1.58847]), the distance is about 3.89 m. This means an improvement of only ~0.30 m.  \n• For Trajectory 2, the robot starts at (–1.992, 0.009, 2.461) which is about 1.97 m from the sponge and ends at (–0.982, 0.00967, 2.274), a distance of about 1.02 m.

Comparing the robot’s actions ([2, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) with the expert-provided actions (starting with [1, 0, 0, 0, …]), we see some mismatches (for example, the first action is different and similarly at the fourth step).  \n• In Trajectory 2 no expert action data is given, so we cannot evaluate conformity here.  \nSince progress and expert alignment are equally weighted in this phase, note that while Trajectory 1 shows less progress and some divergence from the expert, Trajectory 2 shows clear progress. In the absence of expert guidance for Trajectory 2, the strong progress stands.\n\nStep 4.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Checking terminal conditions:\n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 there is no reported success (none reached the sponge) and no collision events occurred. Neither trajectory has ended by collision or success, and neither was truncated. So based on our highest‐priority condition (success vs. collision), neither trajectory “succeeded” or “failed” in this respect.\n\nStep 2. Examining progress:\n• For progress we compare the robot’s distance to the fixed sponge from the beginning to the end of each segment (remember that the numbers need to be compared relative to each segment’s starting position).\n  – Trajectory 1: Its starting position (approximately [–0.3123, 0.0089, –1.3134]) is about 3.59 m (Euclidean estimate) from the sponge, and its final position ([–0.4841, 0.0099, –1.3571]) is roughly 3.64 m away. This indicates only a minimal change (a slight regression, if any).\n  – Trajectory 2: Its starting position (approximately [–0.7103, 0.0086, –1.6760]) is about 3.98 m from the sponge, and its final position ([–0.2128, 0.0087, –1.8690]) is roughly 4.13 m away.

Comparing adherence to expert actions:\n• Expert actions are provided alongside each trajectory.\n  – Trajectory 1’s actions (1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2) match the expert’s recommended sequence (which starts with several 1’s/0’s) only in a few places.\n  – Trajectory 2’s actions (1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 2) have slightly more agreement with the corresponding expert guidance.\nHowever, because progress and goal achievement are equally weighted, the (slight) better progress result of Trajectory 1 is important. Trajectory 1 shows a smaller regression relative to its starting position toward the sponge even if its action sequence does not perfectly match the expert. Meanwhile, Trajectory 2, although it shows marginally better expert-action agreement, has a larger negative progress.\n\nStep 4. Overall Evaluation:\nSince no trajectory has succeeded yet and both are collision‐free and non‐truncated, the next levels of priority are progress and matching expert actions (each weighted equally).

In Trajectory 1 the robot’s final position is farther in the opposite direction relative to the sponge compared to its starting position, giving a larger (more negative) progress value.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Checking for collision or success:\n• In both trajectories there is no success (none actually reached the sponge) and no collisions. So at the highest priority level (safety and achieving the goal) neither trajectory “succeeded” nor “failed” by colliding.\n\nStep 2. Evaluating progress and conformity to expert actions:\n• Progress: The sponge is at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. Looking at the positions (using the first and third coordinates as a representative 2D plane), Trajectory 1 starts at about (–0.619, –2.049) and ends at about (–1.121, –2.137). When compared to the sponge’s location, the distance in Trajectory 1 increases slightly over the segment, indicating the robot is not moving toward the goal.\n• In Trajectory 2, the robot starts at about (1.748, 1.735) and moves toward (0.634, 1.574). Relative to the sponge, this represents a significant reduction in distance (calculated roughly as going from roughly 1.92m away to approximately 0.99m away). Hence, Trajectory 2 makes clear progress toward the sponge.\n• Expert actions: The expert in Trajectory 1 provided two forward moves [0, 0], while the robot’s actions include many turns, which diverges from the expert’s simple plan. In Trajectory 2, although there are some differences (the expert suggests [0, 1, 0, …] and the robot took some turns), the movement overall remains more directed toward the sponge. Given that progress and following the expert plan share equal weight (after success/collision), the strong progress in Trajectory 2 is a notable advantage.\n\nStep 3. Considering truncation:\n• Neither trajectory exhibits episode termination or truncation, so this factor does not impact the evaluation.\n\nConclusion:\nBased on the key criteria, Trajectory 2 demonstrates clear progress towards the sponge while Trajectory 1 does not. Both meet the safety requirement, but Trajectory 2 is the better of the two in terms of moving toward the goal and aligning more with an expert-inspired plan.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2568, "output_token_count": 2259}

In other words, the robot’s movement in Trajectory 1 appears to be going farther away from the sponge by roughly 0.29 m.\n ○ Trajectory 2: The distance to the sponge similarly worsened over the segment, but by a much smaller margin (around 0.09 m). \nThus Trajectory 2 shows less “back‐tracking” relative to its starting position.\n\nExpert Actions:\n– Trajectory 1 has a corresponding expert action sequence provided.

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step‐by‐step, following the stated prioritization:\n\n1. Success/Collision (highest priority):  \n • Neither trajectory ended in success (reaching the sponge) and neither suffered any collision.  \n  → So on this front the two are equivalent.\n\n2. Progress and Following Expert Actions (second priority, equal weight):  \n\n a. Progress Toward the Sponge  \n  • The “progress” is judged not by the absolute distance to the target but by how much farther along the expected “line” to the sponge the robot moved relative to its starting point.  \n  • In Trajectory 1 the start position is about (–2.01, 0.009, 1.157) while the final position is roughly (–1.72, 0.009, 1.199). Compared with the sponge’s position (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227), the robot in Trajectory 1 shows a clear “advance” toward the goal (its distance to the target decreases by roughly 0.27 m, or, when measured along the vector toward the sponge, a clear positive progress is made).  \n  • In Trajectory 2 the start position is (–0.766, 0.009, 1.226) – already “closer” in one sense – but the final observation is (–0.244, 0.010, 0.963). In fact, the Euclidean “distance to the sponge” got slightly worse (an increase of roughly 0.07 m) rather than an improvement.  \n  → Thus, Trajectory 1 shows good progress toward the target while Trajectory 2 essentially fails to improve (in fact, it gets a little worse).\n\n b. Following the Expert’s Actions  \n  • Expert Actions 1 (for Trajectory 1) were a long sequence of “move forward” (action 0) with only one later deviation. When comparing step‐by‐step, Trajectory 1’s actual action sequence (0, 2, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2) only agrees with the expert on the first move and the third move – only about 20% matching overall.  \n  • For Trajectory 2, the expert sequence (Expert Actions 2: [0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) compared over the 10 steps shows better agreement (matching approximately 5 out of 10, or 50%).  \n  → Therefore, Trajectory 2 is a better “mimic” of what the expert would do.\n\n3. Putting It Together  \n • Although Trajectory 2 follows expert actions more closely, the environment’s goal is to approach the sponge. Trajectory 1 shows clear progress toward the target (a reduction in distance) while Trajectory 2 ends up a little farther away than it started.  \n • Since the second level criteria requires equal attention to “progress” and “following the expert” and making actual progress toward the sponge is critical in a care/bathing scenario, the positive progress in Trajectory&nbsp;1 outweighs the relatively poorer expert mimicry.  \n\nThus, while neither trajectory is “completed” (i.e. no success case) and Traj. 2 did better in imitating the expert actions, Trajectory 1 better advances toward achieving the primary goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2641, "output_token_count": 7667}

Both are “ongoing” (no collision, not terminated, not truncated). So at this highest‐priority level they are tied.\n\n2. Progress and Conformance to Expert Actions:  \n• Progress: For each segment we can compare the robot’s starting and ending positions relative to the sponge (whose coordinates are approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]).  \n – In Trajectory 1 the robot starts at about [–0.208, 0.009, 1.040] and ends at about [–0.066, 0.009, 0.893]. When we examine the Euclidean distance to the sponge the result is that the ending state is actually farther from the sponge than the starting state (for example, the z‑difference grows from roughly 1.19 to about 1.33).  \n – In Trajectory 2 the robot starts at roughly [–0.593, 0.009, –1.385] and ends at [–0.319, 0.009, –1.112]. Although both the start and end are much farther from the sponge (and possibly in a different region), the computed distance to the sponge decreases (from about 3.68 to 3.39). Even though the absolute numbers are not near completion, Trajectory 2 shows positive progress relative to its starting point.  \n\n• Following Expert Actions:  \n – For Trajectory 1, the expert provided a three‐action sequence [1, 1, 0]. The robot in Trajectory 1 took actions [1, 2, 1, …]. Here, only the first action matched and the subsequent two (when comparing the similar initial steps) deviated from the expert’s suggestion.  \n – For Trajectory 2, the expert actions (a longer sequence) and the robot’s actions show a few matches – for example, step 1 is correct, as well as some later steps. (Overall, while both trajectories do not perfectly follow the expert, the progress improvement in Trajectory 2 outweighs the similar level of mismatches.)  \n\n3.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Both trajectories are incomplete – neither reaches the sponge (success is never flagged) and no collision occurs. Therefore, the foremost priority (achieving the goal via success or collision avoidance) is neutral between them.\n\nStep 2. Next we check progress toward the sponge. The goal sponge is at approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. For Trajectory 1, the starting position is about [–0.593, 0.009, –1.385] and it ends near [–0.319, 0.009, –1.112]. Although the movement is modest, the displacement is in a generally “forward” direction relative to the vector from the start toward the sponge (especially along the z‐axis, where an increase is needed). A rough projection of Trajectory 1’s movement along the direction toward the sponge shows a positive progress (about 30% of the way, in a relative sense).\n\nIn contrast, Trajectory 2 starts at roughly [–0.208, 0.009, 1.040] with the sponge about [0.098, 0.524, 1.187] away in component form, but by its end – near [–0.066, 0.009, 0.893] – the robot has actually moved in the opposite direction along the z‐axis (the z value decreased), which is opposite to where the sponge is. This indicates negative progress relative to the goal.\n\nStep 3. In addition, we compare the robot’s actions with expert actions. For Trajectory 1 the expert sequence is longer (13 steps) and the robot’s 10 actions start with a 1 that agrees with the expert’s first action. For Trajectory 2 the expert sequence is only 3 actions long and the robot does not closely match them (e.g. the second action is 2 versus expert’s 1). However, given that progress toward the sponge is weighted equally with matching expert actions, the fact that Trajectory 2 makes negative progress is a significant drawback.\n\nConclusion. Although neither segment finishes the episode, Trajectory 1 shows clear positive progress toward the sponge and is relatively closer to the expert’s intended action pattern.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Evaluate success/collision:\n• In both trajectories, the robot did not reach the sponge (success = false) and there were no collisions (collision = 0). Both trajectories are ongoing, so neither has achieved the goal by the foremost success/collision criteria.\n\nStep 2. Evaluate progress and agreement with expert actions:\n• Trajectory 1 starts near (–0.693, 0.009) and ends near (–0.483, 0.009) in the xy‐plane, while the sponge is at approximately (–0.109, 0.533). This corresponds to a reduction in distance of only about 0.14 m relative to its starting position.\n• Trajectory 2, on the other hand, starts far from the goal (around (1.517, 0.009)) and ends around (–0.370, 0.009). The distance to the sponge reduces by roughly 1.12 m over the segment, showing much more progress toward the goal.\n• In terms of following expert actions, Trajectory 1’s action sequence deviates significantly from the expert sequence ([0, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1] vs. expert’s [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]), whereas Trajectory 2’s actions are all 0, which exactly match the expert’s provided action sequence ([0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).\n\nStep 3.

Evaluating Progress Toward the Sponge:\n• Trajectory 1 starts at (approximately) [1.5173, 0.0089] and ends at about [–0.3696, 0.0097]. Compared with the sponge position (≈[–0.109, 0.533]), its distance to the goal decreases from roughly 1.71 meters to about 0.58 meters.

Comparing to Expert Actions:\n• Expert Actions for Trajectory 1 are all “0” (move forward) and the robot performed exactly those, indicating action agreement.\n• For Trajectory 2 the expert actions start with “0” but then shift to turns.

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step by step using our three priority criteria:\n\n──────────────────────────────\n1. Overall Goal Attainment (Success/Collision)\n\n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 the episode is still ongoing – no collision has occurred, and the robot has not yet reached (i.e. “successfully” grabbed) the sponge. \n• Thus, with respect to the highest‐priority criterion (success vs. collision), both are equivalent (no success but also no collision).\n\n──────────────────────────────\n2. Progress Toward the Sponge and Following Expert Actions\n\nProgress:\n• We need to compare how much closer the robot gets to the sponge compared to its starting point (remember that even if the absolute distance is different, the progress is measured by the change relative to each segment’s start).\n• For Trajectory 1 the starting distance from the sponge (using the first three numbers as the robot’s position) is approximately 4.15 m and the final distance is about 4.21 m. That is an increase of roughly 0.07 m.\n• For Trajectory 2 the starting distance comes out near 3.83 m and the final distance near 3.93 m – an increase of about 0.10 m.\n• Since the goal is to move toward the sponge, a smaller “drift” away (or, ideally, a decrease in distance) is desirable. Trajectory 1 shows a smaller back‐step from its starting point compared to Trajectory 2, meaning it makes slightly “better” progress relative to its own starting point.\n\nFollowing the Expert Actions:\n• In both trajectories we compare the robot’s chosen actions (a sequence of 10 moves) with the expert’s recommended actions (we align with the first 10 expert actions provided).\n• Trajectory 1 matches the expert’s action at steps 4 and 7 (2 out of 10) while Trajectory 2 also matches at steps 4 and 9 (again 2 out of 10). \n• Thus, both deviate similarly from the expert’s recommendations.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n3.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Looking at the highest‐priority factor (success/collision), neither trajectory reached the sponge (i.e. success = false) and neither experienced a collision. In that sense they are equivalent.\n\nStep 2. Moving on to progress and imitation: Although neither segment reaches the target, we can compare the relative “progress” (that is, how the robot’s position has changed relative to its own starting point with respect to the sponge) as well as how closely the actions follow the expert’s sequence. In Trajectory 1 the robot’s position shifts from an initial pose that is about 3.83 units (using a Euclidean measure) away from the target to a final pose about 3.93 units away. In Trajectory 2 the distance changes from roughly 4.15 to about 4.22 units. In other words, even though both segments “regress” (i.e. move further away from the goal) the final position of Trajectory 1 is a bit closer to the sponge than that of Trajectory 2. When comparing the action sequences against the expert’s list (which starts with a forward move) both trajectories show considerable deviation, and when roughly tallying the mismatches the quality is similar.\n\nStep 3.

Evaluate progress:\n• Note that progress must be measured not only in absolute distance but as improvement relative to the starting pose.\n• For Trajectory 1, based on the first and last recorded positions, the robot appears to have moved closer to the target sponge (for example, if we compute a rough Euclidean distance from the starting point [–2.3145, …] to the sponge and then from the later position [–1.9637, …] to the sponge, there is a decrease in distance of roughly 0.3 m).\n• For Trajectory 2, although its starting pose was somewhat closer to the sponge, the later position seems to have moved farther from the target (an increase in the computed distance of roughly 0.3 m), indicating negative progress over the segment.\n\nStep 3. Compare agreement with expert actions:\n• Trajectory 1 has no expert action data so no comparison is possible.\n• Trajectory 2 has expert actions [1, 0] provided. However, when checking the robot’s actual actions from the beginning (e.g. the first action is 2 versus the expert’s 1), it does not appear to align well with the expert’s intended behavior.

Overall assessment:\n• With equal weight given to progress and expert actions after checking for collisions/success, Trajectory 1 shows improvement toward the goal (making positive progress), whereas Trajectory 2 regresses in its progress and does not follow the expert guidance.\n• Therefore, Trajectory 1 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2511, "output_token_count": 2239}

{"full_text": "Step 1: Analysis\n\n• Success/Collision: Both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 never reached the sponge (success = false) and never collided (collision = 0 for both). Neither trajectory “succeeded” in the primary sense.\n\n• Progress Toward the Goal and Expert Actions:\n – For both, we compare how much they moved from their initial observation in the segment toward the sponge (located at approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]). A rough check shows that Trajectory 1’s end pose represents a slightly larger improvement (closer by roughly 0.12 m) compared to its start, while Trajectory 2’s progress is a bit less (~0.06 m improvement). \n – For expert action alignment, only Trajectory 2 has an associated set of expert actions. When comparing its executed actions ([0, 2, 1, 2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1]) against the expert’s ([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]), there is agreement on the first action and the sixth but the rest do not match. Trajectory 1 did not have expert actions provided, so we cannot judge its adherence in that way.\n\n• Episode Termination (Truncation):\n – Trajectory 1 ends with a truncation flag on its final step. Although neither hit success nor collision, getting truncated (ending due to too many steps or leaving the designated area) is a negative outcome. \n – Trajectory 2 is not truncated at the final step.\n\nStep 2: Conclusion\n\nEven though Trajectory 1 shows marginally better progress in terms of reducing the distance toward the sponge, the fact that it ends in a truncated episode (an undesired outcome) is a disadvantage. Trajectory 2, while showing a slightly smaller progress improvement and imperfect agreement with expert actions, avoids truncation altogether and is therefore deemed to better achieve the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2524, "output_token_count": 2220}

Based on the Euclidean distances, Trajectory 2 appears to have made a slightly larger progress improvement toward the sponge compared to Trajectory 1.\n• For action alignment, Trajectory 1 has an expert action sequence available. Although its taken actions do not perfectly match the expert’s (for example, after the initial “move forward,” Trajectory 1 takes turns that differ from the expert’s “keep moving forward”), there is at least some basis for comparison. Trajectory 2 does not have any expert actions provided, so no direct comparison can be made on that front.\n\nStep 3: Account for the truncation penalty.\n• The highest priority is success/collision (both are equal and neither trajectory met the goal or had a collision).\n• The next priority is progress and expert action alignment. While Trajectory 2 shows slightly more progress, it has no expert action reference and its progress improvement is only marginal.\n• The final, but important, priority is truncation. Trajectory 2 is truncated – this is undesirable, as it suggests the episode was forcibly ended, whereas Trajectory 1 continued without truncation.\n\nConclusion:\nEven though Trajectory 2 shows a bit more progress, its truncation (and lack of expert action comparison) is a significant penalty.

Progress and Following Expert Actions:  \n• The expert actions for both cases are [0, 0] (i.e. moving forward).  \n• In Trajectory 1, the robot’s starting position (from the first observation) is at approximately [–0.82, 0.009, –2.02] and its final position is around [–0.77, 0.009, –2.45].

In Trajectory 1 the robot’s distance to the sponge (using the first three elements as its position) was reduced by about 0.09 m relative to its short initial gap (~1.47 m).

{"full_text": "Step 1. Both trajectories are “ongoing” (no termination from success, collision, or truncation). That means neither has reached the sponge nor collided. So we look at the secondary evaluation factors: progress (i.e. how much closer the robot moves toward the sponge relative to its starting point) and the similarity to the expert‐provided actions.\n\nLooking at progress, we first “project” each trajectory’s motion in the plane. Using the robot’s reported positions (assuming the first and third numbers in each observation are the x and z coordinates) and the sponge position (x ≈ –0.109, z ≈ 2.227), we see that in Trajectory 1 the robot starts about 4.1 meters away from the sponge and ends roughly 3.9 meters away – a small improvement. In contrast, Trajectory 2 starts around 3.5 meters away (closer initially) but ends about 3.6 meters away, indicating a slight move away from the target relative to its start.\n\nNext, regarding adherence to expert actions:\n• For Trajectory 1 the expert action list (Expert Actions 1) consists almost entirely of “move forward” (action 0) for its first several steps. Trajectory 1 does two forward moves at the start but then takes several turning actions that differ from the expert’s suggestion (only the first, second, and last actions roughly match the forward instruction).\n• For Trajectory 2 the expert actions (Expert Actions 2) are [1, 1, 0, 0] for the initial steps, and Trajectory 2’s first four actions are [1, 2, 2, 0]. This gives a partial match (the first and fourth actions match) although the second and third differ.\n\nThus, while Trajectory 2’s actions are more in line with the expert’s (50% match in its short expert action template compared to roughly 30% for Trajectory 1), its movement does not yield progress toward the sponge—in fact, it regresses slightly. Trajectory 1, despite diverging more from the expert’s recommended actions, does show a modest improvement in getting closer to the goal.\n\nSince the evaluation gives equal weight to progress and expert action adherence (after ruling out collision/success), Trajectory 1’s progress advantage compensates for its lower expert action similarity. There is also no issue with truncation in either case.\n\nStep 2. Therefore, overall, Trajectory 1 better moves the robot toward achieving the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2639, "output_token_count": 3797}

Evaluating progress and following expert actions:\n• Trajectory 1’s start and end positions (using the first three numbers in each observation) indicate that the robot did not appreciably move closer to the sponge – in fact, the computed Euclidean distance from the start to goal increased slightly over the segment.\n• In contrast, Trajectory 2 shows a modest improvement – the robot moved closer to the sponge relative to its starting position.\n\nRegarding following expert actions:\n• For Trajectory 1 the provided expert actions (“[1,1,0,0]”) and the robot’s first four actions (“[1,2,2,0]”) show some mismatches.\n• For Trajectory 2, if we compare the segment’s actions with the initial portion of its expert actions (which are mostly 0’s), there are several deviations as well.

Truncation:\n• Neither trajectory ends in truncation.\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough both segments have deviations from the expert actions, Trajectory 2 shows actual progress toward the sponge while Trajectory 1 does not. Therefore, Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2639, "output_token_count": 2291}

{"full_text": "Step 1. Both trajectories did not record any success (i.e. reaching the sponge) and they did not result in collisions or truncation. Therefore, the foremost priority (success/collision) is equal for both.\n\nStep 2. Evaluating progress (the second priority):  \n• In Trajectory 1 the robot’s starting position is at about (–0.575, 0.009, 1.080) and its end position is near (–0.721, 0.009, 1.218).

In this case, relative to the location of the sponge the robot actually regressed in progress – it moved further from the target when measurements are compared. \n\nStep 3. Comparing expert actions:  \n• Expert Actions for Trajectory 1 were given as a ten–step sequence (mostly “move forward” actions, with an initial “turn right”) while the robot’s actions in Trajectory 1 (1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1) show some deviations from the experts’ simple strategy.  \n• For Trajectory 2, the provided expert sequence (three actions: [1, 1, 0]) only partially aligns because the robot’s three actions ([1, 2, 2]) already differ (the second and third actions diverge).  \n\nSince the primary goal (successful grasp via contact with the sponge) was not achieved by either, we rely on secondary measures. In this respect, Trajectory 1, by making a (small) positive progress movement in the direction of the sponge (even if not perfectly aligned) and having a longer action sequence in which its overall behavior is more “structured” than Trajectory 2’s regression, appears to be better oriented to the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2570, "output_token_count": 2484}

{"full_text": "Step 1. First, let’s check the primary priority: reaching the sponge (or collision avoidance). Neither trajectory terminated with “success” (reaching the sponge) nor experienced a collision and neither was truncated. That means we need to move on to the next priorities.\n\nStep 2. Second, we compare “progress” and how the robot’s actions compare with expert actions. Since the segments start at different positions, we examine the relative progress along the “sponge direction” (from the starting observation toward the sponge). \n\n• In Trajectory 1 the robot’s starting position is approximately [–0.4321, 0.00877, 1.5487] while the sponge is at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. Thus, the ideal displacement vector from start to sponge would be about [0.3231, 0.5242, 0.6783]. However, by the end of the segment (position ≈ [–0.9878, 0.00864, 1.6123]), the robot has moved by roughly [–0.5557, 0.000, 0.0636] from its start. When you project this displacement along the ideal “sponge” direction the resulting progress comes out negative – meaning that relative to its starting position, Trajectory 1 moved away from the intended target.\n\n• In Trajectory 2 the starting position is roughly [0.4598, 0.00979, –1.3568] with the corresponding direction to the sponge being approximately the vector [–0.5688, 0.5232, 3.5838]. Over the segment the robot moved to an ending position near [0.2804, 0.00882, –1.2935]. This gives a displacement of about [–0.1794, –0.0010, 0.0633]. When projected along the direction to the sponge the result is a small positive value (about +0.09 m) indicating some progress toward the sponge.\n\nNext, consider the expert action similarity. For Trajectory 1, the expert actions given (Expert Actions 1) are [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, …] while Trajectory 1’s actions are [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, …]. There are some matches (for instance, the second action agrees, and several later steps align with a 0), but overall the match rate is moderate. For Trajectory 2, even though the expert actions provided (Expert Actions 2) cover just four steps ([0, 0, 0, 0]), Trajectory 2’s first two actions are 0 (matching) and then it deviates. Thus, while neither trajectory perfectly follows the expert commands, Trajectory 2 shows better progress along the intended direction.\n\nStep 3. Finally, neither trajectory was truncated or ended by collision, so that factor does not alter the ranking.\n\nSummary:\n– Trajectory 1 does not make progress toward the sponge (in fact, it appears to move away relative to the ideal direction) and its actions match the expert only partially.\n– Trajectory 2 makes a small positive progress toward the sponge and shows reasonable initial expert alignment.\n\nTherefore, based on all considerations with equal weight on progress and expert action similarity (after ruling out termination events), Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2581, "output_token_count": 2841}

The sponge’s position is at approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227].  \n  – In Trajectory 1 the robot’s start position is about [–1.73, 0.009, –0.88] and it later moves closer to [–1.67, 0.009, –0.68]. Even though the robot is still far from the sponge, the change in its pose indicates that it has moved in the “right direction” relative to where it started.  \n  – In Trajectory 2 the robot’s starting pose is roughly [–0.818, 0.060, 1.914] and its final recorded observation is nearly identical – showing very little change in position.  \n • Expert actions:  \n  – For Trajectory 1 no expert actions were provided, so we cannot compare behavior to an “expert baseline” for that segment.  \n  – For Trajectory 2 there is a full list of expert actions provided; however, the robot’s own actions (which include repeated turns by “2”) differ noticeably from the predominance of “0” (forward) commands in the expert data. This suggests that Trajectory 2 does not closely follow the expert policy.  \n • Overall the progress in Trajectory 1 (i.e. measurable movement toward the sponge) is better than the near-zero change in position for Trajectory 2, and there is less compliance with expert actions in Trajectory 2.\n\n3.

{"full_text": "Step 1: Review of Key Factors\n\n• Priority 1 is success vs. collision. In Trajectory 1, the episode terminated with a collision (collision flag = 1 at the last step), whereas Trajectory 2 shows no collision and the episode remains ongoing. Collision is highly detrimental, so any collision greatly reduces the quality of the trajectory regardless of progress.\n\n• Next, we consider progress and adherence to expert actions. Although Trajectory 1 seems to have made some progress (its positions changed, possibly moving in the direction of the sponge), the collision makes that progress irrelevant. Trajectory 2, starting from a different relative position, consistently moves from a higher “x” value toward a lower “x” value (with the sponge at around –0.109 in x) and generally makes progress toward the goal. Moreover, the provided expert actions for Trajectory 2 are all “move forward” (action 0), and the very first action in Trajectory 2 is move forward. In contrast, Trajectory 1’s actions include turns that did not prevent the eventual collision.\n\n• Finally, while neither trajectory is truncated, the top priorities (collision and progress) weigh against Trajectory 1.\n\nStep 2: Conclusion\n\nGiven that Trajectory 1 ended in a collision (undermining goal achievement) and Trajectory 2 made steady progress without collision, Trajectory 2 is clearly better for achieving the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2523, "output_token_count": 1710}

However, its sequence of actions (0, 1, 2, 2, 1, …) differs somewhat from the expert’s suggested actions (all 0’s) which would have indicated straightforward forward movement.\n• Trajectory 2: Even if progress might be argued, the collision outweighs any progress benefits.

{"full_text": "Step 1 – Goal Achievement Evaluation:\n• Both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 do not report a success (i.e. reaching the sponge) and neither suffer a collision.

Even though the absolute distances remain large, the idea is to measure how much the robot has advanced toward the target.\n• In Trajectory 1 the displacement relative to the starting point results in almost no progress (and even a slight regression in the component that points toward the sponge).\n• In Trajectory 2 the movement from the start to the end shows a more positive displacement in the direction of the sponge—even if modest, it is notably better than Trajectory 1’s negligible progress.\n\nStep 3 – Expert Action Alignment:\n• Trajectory 1 comes with a sequence of expert actions. A step‐by‐step comparison shows that the robot’s actions match the expert’s only about half the time. That mixed adherence means its behavior is not strongly aligned with the recommended (presumably effective) strategy.\n• Trajectory 2 does not have any expert actions provided. Thus, no deviation from expert guidance can be evaluated here. However, since the highest‐priority outcomes (success/collision) are equal and the next equally weighted criteria include progress, the more promising progress in Trajectory 2 lends it an edge.\n\nStep 4 – Truncation:\n• Neither trajectory was truncated. So truncation does not affect the ranking.\n\nConclusion:\n• Since both segments remain incomplete regarding success/collision, the next most important criteria are progress and following the expert’s actions.\n• Trajectory 1 shows only minimal progress and only moderate expert action alignment.\n• Trajectory 2, while not backed by an expert action comparison, shows notably better progress toward the sponge.\nThus, Trajectory 2 is better in terms of the overall priorities.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2625, "output_token_count": 3402}

{"full_text": "Step 1 – Checking success/collision:  \n• In both trajectories no step shows a success (i.e. the robot never reaches the sponge) and no collision is reported. Thus, on the highest‐priority criterion neither trajectory “succeeded” nor “failed” by collision.\n\nStep 2 – Evaluating progress:  \n• The evaluation must consider the robot’s displacement along the direction from its starting position to the sponge.  \n  ◦ Trajectory 1 starts at (approximately) (–0.722, 0.009) and ends at (–0.856, 0.009) while the goal is (–0.109, 0.533). Computing the desired direction from the start gives a vector of about (0.613, 0.524); the robot’s net displacement projects onto this direction with a value near –0.082. This “negative” projection indicates it is moving slightly away from the target—but only about 10% “waste” relative to the expected progress from its starting‐position.  \n  ◦ Trajectory 2, starting at (–0.302, 0.009) and ending at (–0.713, 0.009), has a desired goal vector of about (0.193, 0.524) so its displacement projects to roughly –0.079. Although the absolute negative shift is very similar (around –0.08m), when normalized by the shorter start–goal distance (~0.56m) it represents roughly a 14% setback.  \n• In summary, Trajectory 1 shows a slightly smaller relative “backward” movement toward the goal compared to Trajectory 2.\n\nStep 3 – Comparing expert action alignment:  \n• For Trajectory 1 one expert action is provided ([0]), but the robot’s first (and subsequent) action is 2 (and a series of varied actions). This single–step expert reference is not followed by the robot.  \n• In Trajectory 2 an extended expert action sequence is given; when comparing the first 10 robot actions to the corresponding expert actions (the expert sequence begins with [1, 0, 0, 0,…]), we see that the robot’s first action is 1 (a match) and overall there are several steps (steps 1, 4, 8, and 10) in which the robot’s action coincides with the expert’s. Even though many steps do not match, the percentage of expert–aligned actions is higher in Trajectory 2 (roughly 40% correct) versus Trajectory 1 (a complete deviation from the expected single expert action).  \n\nStep 4 – Weighing the criteria equally (progress and expert alignment):  \n• On progress, Trajectory 1 is a bit better (about a 10% deviation vs. about 14% for Trajectory 2).  \n• On expert action following, Trajectory 2 is clearly ahead (with several matches) while Trajectory 1 does not follow the provided expert directive.  \n• With equal weight on these secondary criteria, the overall performance of Trajectory 2 comes out ahead because even though its progress “regression” is slightly larger in percentage terms, it better mimics the expert’s behavior—a key cue in these scenarios.\n\nStep 5 – Truncation:  \n• Both trajectories make no mention of truncation issues, so this factor does not alter the decision.\n\nConclusion:  \nAlthough neither trajectory reaches the goal and both show some negative progress, Trajectory 2 better aligns with the expert’s actions while remaining comparable in progress.

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step‐by‐step.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 1. Outcome (Success/Collision/Truncation)\n\n• Both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 are “ongoing” (no success; no collision; not truncated). \n• Since neither trajectory terminated with success (reaching the sponge) or with collision, we need to look at the next criteria.\n\n───────────────────────────── \nStep 2. Progress Toward the Sponge\n\nRemember that “progress” here is measured relative to the start of the segment—not simply by the absolute distance from the target but by whether the motion makes the robot approach the sponge. The sponge’s given position is \n  [-0.109, 0.533, 2.227].\n\nFor Trajectory 1:\n – The first observation’s position is about (–0.302, 0.009, –1.004).  \n – The last observation’s position is about (–0.713, 0.009, –1.156).  \n When we compute the “direction‐to-goal” vector from the starting point, the robot should ideally move in a direction that reduces the gap between its current pose and the sponge. In Trajectory 1 the computed displacement (roughly [–0.41, 0.0005, –0.15]) has a negative dot product with the vector from the start to the sponge. In other words, the robot is “moving away” from the target (a clearly undesirable outcome).\n\nFor Trajectory 2:\n – The first observation is approximately (–0.722, 0.009, –1.764).  \n – The final observation is about (–0.856, 0.009, –1.741).  \n When comparing the displacement here (roughly [–0.134, 0.0003, +0.023]) with the “start‐to-goal” vector, the dot product comes out near zero. This suggests that Trajectory 2 is not making strong forward (or backward) progress – it’s essentially “staying on the same relative level” rather than actively moving away from the goal.\n\nThus, while neither segment shows clear improvement toward the sponge, Trajectory 1 is actually moving in the wrong “general” direction (i.e. its net motion has a component that increases the distance toward the target), whereas Trajectory 2 at least does not show that regression.\n\n─────────────────────────────\nStep 3. Agreement With Expert Actions\n\nThe expert action sequences are used as a guideline.\n • For Trajectory 1, the expert actions provided span many steps. Comparing the first 10 robot actions:\n  – Robot Trajectory 1: [1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 2, 0]\n  – Expert (first 10 steps extrapolated from the longer list): [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n  We see that Trajectory 1’s first action matches (1 vs 1) and a few later steps (e.g. the fourth and tenth steps are 0, as the expert recommends). Overall, though, it matches roughly 4 out of 10 steps.\n • For Trajectory 2, the expert-provided action list is just [0]. (It appears incomplete.) In effect the expert would have recommended “Move forward” (action 0) at that similar starting condition. Yet Trajectory 2’s first action is 2 (turn right) and only its second action is 0. So on a step-by-step basis it is farther off the single expert recommendation – implying poorer alignment in following the expert guidance.\n\n─────────────────────────────\nStep 4. Overall Evaluation Given Equal Weight on Progress and Expert Matching\n\n• Outcome: Both have no success/collision, so we look to progress and expert matching.\n• Progress: Trajectory 1 actually “goes backward” (i.e. in a direction that increases the gap toward the sponge), while Trajectory 2 shows almost no net progress – which is at least nonnegative.\n• Following Expert: Trajectory 1’s action sequence (with multiple steps) shows a few matches with the expert sequence, whereas Trajectory 2, coming off a single recommendation, does not align well in its first action and successive steps.\n• However, since reaching the goal is paramount, making “negative” progress (i.e. moving in the wrong direction) is highly undesirable. Even though Trajectory 1 sometimes follows the expert’s command better, its overall motion is regressing relative to the sponge.\n\n─────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n\nBecause the primary priority is the eventual successful approach of the sponge, Trajectory 2 — which at least does not show a component of movement away from the target — is preferable despite its poorer alignment with the single expert action provided.\n\n─────────────────────────────\nFinal Answer\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2632, "output_token_count": 5472}

{"full_text": "Step 1. Goal achievement evaluation\n\n• Success/Collision: Neither trajectory ended the episode (no success flag, no collision), so we must evaluate based on progress and expert‐action compliance.\n\nStep 2. Progress evaluation\n\nSince the sponge is at (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227) and the observation arrays show positions (the first three numbers, with the middle value likely representing a constant floor level), we can compare progress in the horizontal (x, z) plane. For Trajectory 1 the initial (x, z) is roughly (–1.054, –1.720) while the final is about (–1.056, –2.215). The intended direction—from the starting point toward the sponge at (–0.109, 2.227)—suggests that “moving toward” would mean reducing that difference. Trajectory 1’s displacement turned out to be in the “wrong” direction relative to the desired vector (its computed displacement along the goal’s direction is negative by about 0.48 m).\n\nFor Trajectory 2 the (x, z) starts near (–0.484, 1.377) (already much closer to the goal) and moves to roughly (–1.511, 1.484). When projecting this displacement along the ideal direction (from its own start to the sponge) the value is about –0.32 m – i.e. also not “forward,” but less off‐course than Trajectory 1. (Note that because the segments start in different locations, we judge “progress” as the displacement toward the goal relative to that segment’s starting point.)\n\nStep 3. Compliance with expert actions\n\nThe expert in both cases recommends action 0 (“move forward”). Trajectory 1’s action sequence (2, 1, 0, 0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1) includes only two forward commands. Trajectory 2’s action sequence (2, 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0) uses several forward moves. Thus, despite both segments not making proper progress toward the target, Trajectory 2 follows the expert’s “forward” recommendation more closely.\n\nStep 4. Truncation\n\nNeither segment was truncated.\n\nSummary\n\nNeither segment reached the sponge (no success) and neither had a collision. However, in terms of progress the robot in Trajectory 2 “regressed” less relative to its own start and followed the expert’s recommended forward move more frequently. Therefore, considering the equal weight for progress and following expert actions (after the primary safety criteria), Trajectory 2 is slightly better.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2509, "output_token_count": 4292}

Since success/collision are the highest‐level criteria, both are “neutral” in that respect.\n\nStep 2.

In Trajectory 2, although the robot starts overall closer (about 3.71 units away), it actually ends slightly farther (around 3.77 unit difference), indicating a lack of progress (or a slight regression) within the segment.\n • Also, comparing the robot’s actions with the expert actions shows that Trajectory 1 has a slightly higher match (about 4 out of 10 steps match) compared to Trajectory 2 (around 3 out of 10).

Check the primary objective – success or collision:\n• In both trajectories the episode terminated with a collision (collision value “1” in the final step, with no success flag).

Compared to the sponge’s position at (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227), this segment shows a significant reduction in the distance (from about 2.12 m down to roughly 0.95 m).

{"full_text": "Let’s break the evaluation down step‐by‐step according to the priorities:\n\n1. Success or Collision (highest priority):  \n • Both trajectories have no reported collision, and neither has reached the sponge (success flags are all “false”).  \n  ⇒ So neither trajectory is “completed” by a success (grasping the sponge) nor has “failed” by a collision.\n\n2. Progress toward the goal AND following the expert’s actions (equal weightage):  \n a. Progress:  \n  – Although the two segments start at different locations, we can consider the displacement “towards” the sponge (whose position is [-0.109, 0.533, 2.227]).  \n  • For Trajectory 1 the starting robot location is around (–2.02, 0.009, 2.52) and the ending one is about (–2.12, 0.009, 2.246). In effect the motion relative to the direction toward the sponge (from about 2.01m away initially) appears to be slightly “back‐tracking” (the net movement along that direction is negative).  \n  • For Trajectory 2 the segment starts at (–0.886, 0.010, –1.425) (much farther from the sponge at about 3.77m away) and ends at roughly (–0.975, 0.009, –1.420); computing the displacement along the vector toward the sponge shows only a very small (nearly negligible) movement.  \n  Even though neither has made positive progress, Trajectory 2’s net progress “degradation” is a little less severe than Trajectory 1’s when comparing the displacement (relative to their starting positions), meaning Trajectory 2 drifts away from the goal less than Trajectory 1.\n b. Conformity to Expert Actions:  \n  • In Trajectory 1 an expert action sequence is provided. The expert, for example, favors action 0 (moving forward) in most cases – but the robot in Trajectory 1 is executing turns (actions 1 and 2) most of the time. This is a relatively poor match to the expert’s behavior in a similar context.  \n  • For Trajectory 2 no expert actions are given. In such a situation we cannot compare conformity directly. However, because the additional penalty (or bonus) for diverging from the expert is unavailable here, we use the progress metric as a proxy for “goodness” in following what would be an expert strategy.\n  Taking both on equal footing, the slight advantage in “progress” (i.e. less negative movement toward the sponge) for Trajectory 2 and the fact that Trajectory 1 clearly deviates from the expert guidance both point toward Trajectory 2 as the preferable one.\n\n3. Truncation:  \n • Neither segment is truncated (no overly long sequences or roaming out of bounds).\n\nConclusion:\nNeither trajectory has completed the goal (sponge grasp) yet, but when considering progress and adherence to expected behavior, Trajectory 2 shows slightly less regression in progress and avoids an obvious deviation from the expected “forward‐oriented” style seen in the expert’s actions (even though expert actions were not provided directly for T2).  \nThus, even if modest, the overall evaluation points to Trajectory 2 as having a better chance of reaching the goal compared to Trajectory 1.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2558, "output_token_count": 4057}
{"full_text": "Let’s break the problem into the prescribed priorities.\n\n1. First Priority – Success/Collision:\n • In both trajectories there is no reported success (reaching the sponge) and no collision. (Both “success” entries are false and “collision” entries are all 0.) So neither trajectory has “completed” the episode in a desirable (or clearly undesirable) way.\n\n2. Second Priority – Progress and Expert‐Action Alignment:\n • Because segments may have different start locations, we compare “progress” by looking at the change in the robot’s distance to the sponge (whose position is: [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]) from the segment’s start to its end.\n  – For Trajectory 1, if we interpret the first three numbers in each observation as the robot’s position, the start position is about (–0.886, 0.0097, –1.4252) and the final position is about (–0.975, 0.0091, –1.4197). The Euclidean distance from these points to the sponge are roughly 3.77 m at the start and 3.79 m at the end. That is, in relative terms the robot has moved only by about 0.02 m away from the goal – essentially no progress (though almost negligible change).\n  – For Trajectory 2, the start position is about (–2.024, 0.0093, 2.521) and the final position is about (–2.119, 0.0093, 2.246). In this case the start distance to the sponge is about 2.01 m and the final distance is roughly 2.08 m. Here the robot ends about 0.07 m farther away than at the start. Although overall the absolute distances in Trajectory 2 are lower (since the segment starts closer to the sponge), relative to its own start the robot “moved away” a little.\n • In addition, an expert-provided action sequence is available for Trajectory 2 (while none is given for Trajectory 1). Comparing the actions, we see that Trajectory 2’s actions (e.g. [1,2,1,2,0,1,…]) do not seem particularly aligned with the majority “move forward” (action 0) that the expert series emphasizes.\n • In summary, although neither completed the goal, when looking at progress relative to each segment’s starting point Trajectory 1’s change in distance is very nearly zero (which is slightly better than moving away) while Trajectory 2’s progress is a bit worse. And in terms of following expert-like actions, Trajectory 2 does not clearly follow the predominance of 0’s in the expert series.\n\n3. Third Priority – Truncation:\n • Neither trajectory has been truncated; both continue well within limits.\n\nOverall Evaluation:\n• Since success and collision are equal for both, we next weigh progress and expert compliance. Trajectory 1 shows nearly no change in distance (a very minor setback) and there is no expert action baseline to penalize it. Trajectory 2, although starting closer to the goal, ends up about 0.07 m further away and its actions do not align well with the expert demonstration.\n• Therefore, despite both not reaching the sponge, Trajectory 1 “better achieves” the goal relative to its own starting point.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2558, "output_token_count": 3541}

{"full_text": "Step 1. Check completion criteria (success/collision):  \n• In both trajectories there is no termination due to either success (reaching the sponge) or collision (all steps show “false” and collision values of 0).

Evaluate progress toward the goal (sponge):  \n• The given target sponge position is at approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227].  \n• For Trajectory 1, using the first and the last observation we roughly estimate the Euclidean distance between the robot’s positions and the sponge as:  \n  – First position (≈ [–1.0575, 0.0092, 1.5049]) is about 1.303 m away.  \n  – Last position (≈ [–0.3136, 0.0094, 1.4728]) is about 0.941 m away.  \n  This suggests that the robot made significant progress toward the sponge in Trajectory 1.  \n• In Trajectory 2, using the corresponding positions:  \n  – First observation (≈ [–0.6406, 0.0098, 1.2484]) is about 1.231 m away.  \n  – Last observation (≈ [–1.1047, 0.0097, 1.4413]) is about 1.373 m away.  \n  This indicates that instead of making progress toward the sponge, the robot’s distance increased slightly.  \n\nStep 3.

So with the top priority equal, we move on to the next criteria.\n\n2. Progress Toward the Goal:  \n • The goal is not only to be close to the sponge but to make progress from the segment’s starting point toward the sponge.  \n • For Trajectory 1, the starting position (first three numbers in the observation) is approximately (–0.64, 0.01, 1.25) while the final position is about (–1.10, 0.01, 1.44). When computing the Euclidean distance from the target sponge position (approximately [–0.11, 0.53, 2.23]), the starting distance is roughly 1.23 m and the ending distance increases to roughly 1.37 m. Thus it appears that Trajectory 1 did not make progress (in fact, it moved slightly away when measured relative to the sponge).  \n • For Trajectory 2, the starting location is approximately (–1.06, 0.01, 1.50) and the final location is (–0.31, 0.01, 1.47).

This significant reduction shows that Trajectory 2 is making clear progress toward reaching the sponge.\n\n3. Following Expert Actions:  \n • In Trajectory 1, the expert action information provided is only a single action [0] (i.e. move forward), and the trajectory’s sequence deviates from that single recommendation with several extra and turning actions.  \n • In Trajectory 2, the expert actions (a 10‐step sequence) are directly comparable to the robot’s chosen actions. For the first four steps, both the expert and the robot choose 0 (move forward). Although there are a few discrepancies later in the sequence, overall the actions are largely in line with the expert’s (with many matching steps).  \n • Hence, Trajectory 2 more closely follows the expert’s intended motions.\n\n4.

In Trajectory 1 the robot started at a certain position and by the final observation reduced its distance to the sponge by about 0.14 m based on computing the “start‐to‐sponge” versus “final‐to‐sponge” distances.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Examining Priority 1 (Success/Collision):\n• In Trajectory 1, there is no collision and no episode termination due to success; it is simply an ongoing segment.\n• In Trajectory 2, there is also no collision and no success, but the final step is marked as truncated. A truncation (due, for example, to too many steps or a deviation from the room) is less desirable.\n\nStep 2. Examining Priority 2 (Progress Toward the Sponge & Alignment with Expert Actions):\n• Although neither trajectory reached the sponge (the target pose is roughly [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]), the progress is judged relative to their starting positions.\n• In Trajectory 1 the robot’s observations suggest movement in the direction (especially along the third coordinate increasing from ~1.53 to ~1.76) which seems to be a positive trend toward the sponge’s z coordinate (2.227). Additionally, there is no expert action guidance available for direct comparison, but this segment is free of other penalties.\n• In Trajectory 2, while there is a sequence of expert actions provided, the robot appears to move in a way that – based on observation values – may be not aligning well with the sponge’s position (for instance, the third coordinate moves in the negative direction away from an expected value near 2.227), compounded by the fact that the segment eventually becomes truncated.\n\nStep 3. Examining Priority 3 (Truncation):\n• Trajectory 1 is not truncated.\n• Trajectory 2 is truncated at the last step, which is a negative factor.\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough neither trajectory achieved the goal (i.e. success) or encountered a collision, when considering progress, action alignment, and the harmful effect of truncation, Trajectory 1 appears to be handling the motion more robustly toward the intended target (the sponge) than Trajectory 2.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2610, "output_token_count": 1753}
{"full_text": "Step 1: Let’s compare the two trajectories according to the priorities.\n\n• Priority 1 (Success or Collision): Neither trajectory reached the sponge (success is false throughout), and neither experienced a collision. So on this critical measure, both are similar.\n\n• Priority 2 (Progress toward the sponge and expert action matching): Although the segments start at different positions, we must measure progress along the direction to the sponge. In Trajectory 1, the robot’s positions (e.g., with z‐values around –1.9 to –2.3) are moving in the opposite direction to the sponge (which is at z ≈ 2.227). This indicates the robot is actually moving away from the target. In Trajectory 2, the robot’s positions (with z ranging from about 1.53 to 1.76) reflect a small but almost neutral or slightly positive displacement toward the sponge when compared to its starting point. In addition, an expert action sequence was provided for Trajectory 1 and there is a noticeable deviation from those expert commands, whereas for Trajectory 2 no expert actions were supplied. So, viewing both progress and adherence to expert guidance together, Trajectory 2 is more promising.\n\n• Priority 3 (Truncation): Trajectory 1 ends with a truncation flag (indicating that the episode was cut off, possibly due to too many steps or wandering away), whereas Trajectory 2 remains ongoing (no truncation).

{"full_text": "Let's break down the evaluation step by step.\n\n1. Neither trajectory ended the episode (no success reached, no collisions, no truncation), so the first priority (episode termination via success or collision) is equally (and neutrally) satisfied by both. This leads us to consider the secondary priorities: progress toward the goal and adherence to expert-provided actions.\n\n• Progress: Because the segments can start in different positions we compare each trajectory’s reduction in distance to the sponge relative to its starting distance. In Trajectory 1 the robot starts at a position very near the sponge in the x‐coordinate (close to –0.11 vs. sponge’s –0.109) but its overall distance from the sponge is about 1.29 m. By the end the distance decreases to about 1.19 m – an improvement of roughly 0.095 m (or about 7% improvement). In Trajectory 2 the robot begins much farther away (about 3.67 m from the sponge) and reduces the distance by roughly 0.113 m (only about a 3% relative improvement).\n\n• Adherence to Expert Actions: The expert commands for Trajectory 1 are [1, 1, 0] and the robot’s first three actions are [1, 0, 2]. There is one match (the first action), which gives a modest similarity. For Trajectory 2 the expert’s suggested sequence is much longer, but in the initial comparable steps the robot’s actions ([1, 2, 1, ...]) match the expert only rarely (only 1 match in the initial several steps). So when viewed proportionally, Trajectory 1’s actions are more similar to the expert’s than are those in Trajectory 2.\n\nSince neither trajectory terminated with a collision or success, the decision comes down to progress and alignment with expert behavior. Trajectory 1 shows a better percentage of progress toward the goal from its starting position and its early actions are slightly closer to the expert’s recommendations.\n\n2. Based on the analysis, Trajectory 1 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2588, "output_token_count": 2934}
{"full_text": "Step 1. Success/Collision Check:\n• Both trajectories did not result in a collision and did not reach the sponge (success remains false). So neither trajectory “finishes” the episode.\n\nStep 2. Progress Toward the Sponge:\n• For Trajectory 1, the robot’s “position” (first three numbers in each observation) starts at about (–0.517, 0.009, –1.382) and ends at about (–0.638, 0.009, –1.252). Compared to the sponge position (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227), the robot reduces its overall distance by roughly 0.11 m along the direction toward the sponge.\n• For Trajectory 2, the start is at (–0.112, 0.010, 1.049) and the end is around (0.054, 0.009, 1.167). Given that its starting distance to the sponge is only about 1.29 m (versus roughly 3.67 m for Trajectory 1), the progress here comes out to be roughly a 0.095 m improvement in the direction toward the sponge.\n• Thus, while both make modest progress, Trajectory 1 shows a slightly larger absolute change. (Note however that because the segments start at different distances from the goal, one must compare how much progress is made “relative to” the starting point; these two results are very close.)\n\nStep 3. Alignment with Expert Actions:\n• For Trajectory 1, the provided expert action sequence is longer ([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]) while the robot’s taken actions were [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 0, 1]. Comparing the first several steps shows that the robot’s actions differ substantially (for example, where the expert suggests “move forward” (0) at the very start, the robot instead “turn left” (1)).\n• For Trajectory 2, the expert’s actions ([1, 1, 0]) are much shorter. When we compare these to the robot’s actions ([1, 0, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1]), the very first action (1) is in agreement, though subsequent actions show some mismatch. Overall, Trajectory 2 appears to adhere slightly better to the expert’s expected behavior (about a 33% match over the overlapping steps versus roughly a 20% match in Trajectory 1).\n\nStep 4. Truncation:\n• Neither segment is truncated.\n\nStep 5. Overall Evaluation:\n• Since neither trajectory completed the task, we turn to the “secondary” criteria. Their shifts toward the sponge are very similar (Trajectory 1 makes a marginally larger progress of about 0.11 m versus 0.095 m in Trajectory 2). However, when equally considering how well the behavior follows expert actions, Trajectory 2 shows a somewhat better match.\n• With our equal weighting of progress and expert alignment, Trajectory 2 edges out the slight advantage even though its absolute progress is a little less.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2588, "output_token_count": 4939}

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation step by step:\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 1: Check Success/Collision\n\n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 the “success” flag is false (i.e. neither reached the sponge) and no collision occurred. \n• So in terms of the foremost requirement (goal met or collision avoided), both are equivalent.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 2: Look at Progress (relative to the robot’s own starting point)\n\n• The “progress” is measured by how much closer the robot gets toward the sponge position (which is given as [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]).  \n• For Trajectory 1 the initial robot pose was roughly [–0.777, …, 1.2357] and during the segment the distance (using a simple Euclidean metric over the x, y, z) initially decreased to about 1.207 (from ~1.304), then slightly regressed.  \n• For Trajectory 2 the starting pose was roughly [–0.405, …, 1.071] and over the segment the distance lowered similarly from ~1.303 to about 1.208 and ended near 1.215.  \n\nAlthough both show a roughly 0.09–0.10 m “improvement” (from their respective starting positions), neither segment shows large progress. In any event the progress improvement in each is very similar.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 3: Compare How Well They Follow the Expert‐generated Actions\n\n• Trajectory 1 does not come with any expert action reference (its expert set is empty), so we have no information about its alignment with expert behavior.  \n• Trajectory 2, however, does have an expert action sequence [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]. Looking at the first six actions taken in Trajectory 2 ([0, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1]), there is only a match at the first step (0 vs. 0) and at the fourth step (1 vs. 1); the other steps differ from the expert suggestions.  \n• Since “follows expert’s actions” carries equal weight with “progress” (after ensuring no collisions/success), a misalignment here is a penalty.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nStep 4: Consider Truncation\n\n• Neither trajectory is truncated. So nothing additional here.\n\n──────────────────────────────\nConclusion\n\n• Both trajectories have not reached the sponge and did not collide (so top priority is equal).  \n• Their progress toward the sponge (using their own starting position as reference) are similar.  \n• However, Trajectory 2 can be compared against an expert planned action sequence and it deviates from it in most steps. In contrast, Trajectory 1 does not provide such a deviation measure.  \n• Since following the expert action is an important second-level priority and Trajectory 2 shows a fair amount of mismatch, Trajectory 1 is preferable (or “better” in this segment) with respect to the overall criteria.\n\n──────────────────────────────\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2535, "output_token_count": 4820}

More importantly, Trajectory 1 shows consistent movement along the x‐axis toward the sponge’s x-coordinate (–0.109).

{"full_text": "Step 1 – Check Completion (Success/Collision/Truncation):\n• Both trajectories show no success (success flag false) and no collisions (collision flag 0) and neither episode is terminated/truncated. So neither has reached the sponge, but also neither has hit obstacles. In terms of the foremost priority (success or collision), both are “ongoing.”\n\nStep 2 – Evaluate Progress & Relative Motion:\n• The goal is to “move toward” the sponge at position roughly [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]. Even though the raw coordinates in these segments are not in the same “region” as the sponge, we examine relative motion. For Trajectory 1 the initial pose is around [–1.93, …, –1.42] and the final pose is around [–2.32, …, –1.33]. When computing the Euclidean error (rough estimate) relative to the sponge, the distance is about 4.1 m at the start and slightly larger (around 4.2 m) at the end. This suggests that relative to their own starting positions the robot did not move toward the target—in fact it may have moved slightly further away.\n• Trajectory 2 starts around [–1.90, …, –0.84] and ends around [–1.76, …, –0.91]. A rough error estimate relative to the sponge shows a distance of about 3.6 m initially and nearly the same at the end. Although the progress is modest, given the starting positions it appears to be closer to the sponge throughout.\n\nStep 3 – Compare Expert Action Adherence:\n• For Trajectory 1 there is an available expert action sequence. The expert mostly recommends moving forward (action “0”), yet the actual actions taken in Trajectory 1 are a mix of turns (actions “1” and “2”) and forwards which show little alignment with the expert’s prescribed forward motion.\n• Trajectory 2 does not have an expert action reference. In the absence of an expert baseline there is less to compare in terms of action mimicry, so we fall back to the progress made.\n\nFinal Comparison:\n• Since both segments have no success or collisions, and the expert behavior is only available for Trajectory 1 (where the robot deviated notably), the next priority (progress) favors Trajectory 2 due to its overall closer proximity to the sponge (relative to its starting position) and less deviation in progress.\n• Truncation is not an issue for either.\n\nThus, based on all considerations with priority given first to outcome (both equal), then progress and alignment (Trajectory 2 fares better), it appears that Trajectory 2 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2588, "output_token_count": 2303}
{"full_text": "Step 1: Assessing Success/Collision\n• In both trajectory segments no success is reached (sponge not reached) and no collision occurred. Thus neither trajectory “wins” or “loses” on the first highly prioritized criterion.\n\nStep 2: Evaluating Progress and Expert Action Agreement\n• Progress is measured relative to the start‐to–sponge direction. In Trajectory 1 the robot advances slightly in the direction from its initial position toward the sponge. In contrast, Trajectory 2’s positional change has a negative projection along that same direction—indicating that it moved away from the sponge.\n• For matching expert actions, Trajectory 2 comes with a set of expert actions (the expert sequence for Trajectory 2, when considered for the available steps, is mostly “Move forward” (action 0), yet the robot’s chosen actions (e.g. many turns) do not closely resemble that expert pattern. Trajectory 1 has an empty expert action list, so we cannot evaluate it on this specific measure—but with the progress advantage being equally weighted with expert agreement, Trajectory 1’s positive progress now gives it an edge.\n\nStep 3: Considering Truncation\n• Neither trajectory is truncated.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven that neither trajectory achieved a goal outcome, the decision comes down to the progress toward the sponge and following the expert’s intended behavior. Trajectory 1 shows a small but positive progress toward the goal while Trajectory 2 actually moves in the opposite direction and does not match the expert’s recommended “move forward” action pattern. \n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2588, "output_token_count": 2184}

{"full_text": "Let’s break down the analysis step‐by‐step:\n\n─────────────────────────\n1. Goal (Success/Collision)\n\n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 none of the “success” flags are true and no collisions occur. (The episode is not completed in either.) \n  – So with respect to collisions and success, neither trajectory “wins.”\n\n─────────────────────────\n2. Progress Toward the Sponge & Alignment with Expert Actions\n\nNote that the target sponge is at (approximately) (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227). However, the two trajectory segments start at very different positions – so we must measure “progress” as the change in distance toward the target from the segment’s start to its end. Equally, we care about how well the actions match those of an expert.\n\n• Trajectory 1:\n ○ Its starting observation is about (–1.750, 0.009, 0.516) and its final observation is about (–2.027, 0.009, 0.399). Compute the Euclidean distance from the robot to the sponge:\n  – At the start: the difference vector ≈ (1.641, 0.524, 1.711) (since sponge – start = (–0.109 – (–1.750), 0.533–0.009, 2.227–0.516))\n    Estimated distance ≈ 2.43 m.\n  – At the end: the difference vector ≈ (1.918, 0.524, 1.828) giving a distance ≈ 2.70 m.\n ○ Thus, from the start to the end, the robot has actually moved farther away relative to the sponge (an increase of roughly 0.27 m). That is negative progress.\n ○ Now compare the actions versus the expert’s suggested actions (Expert Actions 1):\n  – Trajectory 1’s actions are [2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 2] while the expert recommends an action sequence that begins [2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, …]. Comparing step‐by‐step over the 10 steps, approximately 5 of the actions roughly match the expert suggestions. (Approximately a 50% alignment.)\n ○ So although progress is negative, the robot has followed the expert’s commands reasonably well.\n\n• Trajectory 2:\n ○ Its starting observation is about (–1.964, 0.009, –1.865) and its final observation is about (–1.986, 0.010, –1.714). The displacement relative to the sponge (using sponge minus robot position) gives:\n  – At the start: difference ≈ (1.855, 0.524, 4.092) ⇒ distance ≈ 4.52 m.\n  – At the end: difference ≈ (1.877, 0.524, 3.941) ⇒ distance ≈ 4.40 m.\n ○ This shows a slight improvement – the robot has come about 0.13 m closer (a roughly 3% improvement) relative to its starting point.\n ○ Expert Actions 2 are provided as [0, 2, 0, 0, 0, …] while Trajectory 2’s actions are [2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1]. In a step‐wise comparison over the available steps, virtually none of the actions match the expert’s.\n ○ So while Trajectory 2 does show modest positive progress, its actions do not align with expert recommendations at all.\n\n─────────────────────────\n3. Overall Comparison (Equal Weight on Progress and Expert Action Alignment)\n\n• Trajectory 1 scores “well” on expert-alignment (about 50% agreement) but shows negative progress (getting roughly 11% worse relative to its own starting gap).\n• Trajectory 2 makes a small improvement (roughly a 3% positive change toward the target) but has nearly 0% alignment with the expert actions.\n\nSince the two secondary criteria are to be given equal weight, we average the effects. Roughly speaking:\n – Trajectory 1’s positive 50% expert alignment partially “compensates” its negative progress, leading to an overall moderately positive outcome.\n – Trajectory 2 only shows a very slight progress improvement with no expert guidance match.\nThus, even though neither trajectory achieves the goal (final success), Trajectory 1 is overall “better” at following an expert’s guidance that likely would lead to success in a complete episode.\n\n─────────────────────────\n4. Final Decision\n\nGiven that success/collision is the highest priority and neither segment finishes the episode, we rely on the secondary metrics. Trajectory 1’s alignment with the expert actions (and hence its potential to head in the right overall direction) outweighs Trajectory 2’s very modest gain in progress.\n\n─────────────────────────\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2650, "output_token_count": 4288}
{"full_text": "Let’s break down the evaluation.\n\n1. Neither trajectory has actually finished the episode (neither success nor collision nor truncation), so we compare “progress toward the sponge” and “following expert‐recommended actions.”\n\n• Progress toward the sponge:\n – In Trajectory 1 the starting position is about 4.52 m away from the sponge and the final position is about 4.40 m away. That is a modest improvement (a reduction of roughly 0.12 m).\n – In Trajectory 2 the starting distance is only about 2.43 m from the sponge, but the final position ends up at about 2.70 m – meaning it has moved away from the target.\n Thus, in terms of making actual progress toward the goal, Trajectory 1 is outperforming Trajectory 2.\n\n• Following expert actions:\n – For Trajectory 1 the expert actions provided (mostly “go forward” represented by 0) do not match the actions taken (a sequence full of turns – mostly 1’s and 2’s). There is essentially no alignment.\n – For Trajectory 2, when we compare the available expert sequence (using the first 10 actions of the longer sequence) with the actual actions, there are several matches (for example, the first and a few later steps agree) so it achieves about a 50% alignment.\n So in terms of fidelity to the expert policy, Trajectory 2 is clearly better.\n\nSince the two factors (progress and imitation of expert actions) are weighted equally—and progress toward the sponge is fundamentally critical for achieving the goal—a regression in distance (even if partly following the expert) is very undesirable. Trajectory 1, although it does not mimic the expert, does at least show slight improvement on the goal of reaching the sponge.\n\n2.

Therefore, nothing immediately catastrophic happened in either one.\n\nStep 2. Next, we evaluate progress. Because the trajectories start at different locations, we compare the robot’s displacement relative to the direction from its starting position to the sponge. (Expert actions lists are empty, so we cannot judge action similarity; hence only progress matters.)\n\n• For Trajectory 1, the robot starts at approximately (–1.021, 0.009, –1.612) and ends at (–1.011, 0.0095, –1.809). Its displacement is roughly (0.0097, 0.00031, –0.1972). The direction vector from its start to the sponge (–0.109, 0.533, 2.227) is about (0.912, 0.524, 3.839) when computed as sponge minus starting position. The dot‐product of the displacement with this direction comes out significantly negative (about –0.75), indicating that its net movement is opposite to (or away from) the sponge.\n\n• For Trajectory 2, the robot starts at approximately (0.0578, 0.0089, –1.8247) and ends at (–0.0710, 0.00959, –1.9013). Its displacement is roughly (–0.1288, 0.00069, –0.0766). The direction vector from its start to the sponge (again computed as sponge minus starting position) is about (–0.167, 0.524, 4.052). The corresponding dot‐product is around –0.29, which is negative but less so than in Trajectory 1.\n\nStep 3. Comparison. Both trajectories have negative “progress” toward the sponge, but Trajectory 2’s displacement has a smaller negative projection. In effect, Trajectory 2 is “less wrong” – it deviates less from the ideal direction to approach the sponge relative to its starting point. Thus Trajectory 2 is qualitatively closer to progress than Trajectory 1.\n\nStep 4. Final Answer.

{"full_text": "Step 1: Both trajectories have not yet terminated by success (i.e. reaching the sponge) nor ended by collision or truncation. Hence, neither trajectory completed the episode. However, when we look at the progress relative to the goal and the consistency with expert actions we note some differences.\n\n• For Trajectory 1, the robot starts at a position about 4.11 meters away (estimated via Euclidean distance) from the sponge and ends up at about 3.70 meters away. This shows a measurable progress toward the goal. Moreover, with an available expert action sequence, Trajectory 1 shows some degree of alignment at least in the first action and then follows a similar pattern (even if not a perfect match).\n\n• In Trajectory 2, the starting distance to the sponge is already much lower (about 1.16 m), but by the end of the segment the robot is at roughly 1.31 m from the sponge—a slight regression. Also, there is no expert action sequence to compare against, so we only see the slight backtracking in progress.\n\nGiven the priorities (with success/collision being equal for both, then progress and expert alignment), Trajectory 1 shows improvement in moving toward the sponge and some reasonable agreement with expert actions, while Trajectory 2 actually shows a minor worsening of its distance to the goal.\n\nStep 2: Based on the above analysis, Trajectory 1 better achieves the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2558, "output_token_count": 2095}
{"full_text": "Step 1. Check the top priority (success or collision):  \n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 the robot did not reach the sponge (success = false) and there were no collisions. Both segments are ongoing.\n\nStep 2. Evaluate progress toward the goal as well as adherence to the expert actions.  \n– For progress, note that the goal (sponge) is at approximately [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227].  \n • Trajectory 1 starts near [–0.59, 0.009, 1.306] and ends at roughly [–0.587, 0.009, 1.123]. Its distance to the sponge actually increases (from ~1.16 to ~1.31 when computed in a straight-line sense), and the computed displacement projects negatively along the direction to the sponge. This indicates little to no progress toward the goal – in fact, there is slight regression.  \n • In Trajectory 2 the starting position is about [–1.463, 0.009, –1.487] and it ends near [–0.653, 0.009, –1.398]. Here the distance to the sponge decreases (from ~3.99 to ~3.70) and the displacement projects positively toward the goal. Even though the absolute distances are larger due to the different starting positions, Trajectory 2 shows clear progress toward the sponge relative to its start.\n\nStep 3. Examine how the robot’s actions compare to expert actions.  \n– Trajectory 1 does not provide any expert actions to compare with.  \n– Trajectory 2 comes with an expert action sequence. Comparing the first 10 actions of Trajectory 2 ([1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0]) with the corresponding expert actions ([1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) shows that while there are a couple of mismatches, Trajectory 2 at least follows an expert-provided guidance framework. (Note that even if the match is not perfect, the positive progress is significant.)  \n\nStep 4. Check the third priority (truncation):  \n– Neither trajectory is truncated or otherwise penalized by extra steps or moving too far from the room.\n\nConclusion: Although neither segment completed a successful goal, Trajectory 2 demonstrates positive progress toward the sponge and includes expert action guidance. Trajectory 1, on the other hand, shows no progress (in fact, slight regression) and has no expert comparison available. \n\nTherefore, Trajectory 2 is clearly better in achieving the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2558, "output_token_count": 3269}

{"full_text": "Step 1: Evaluate Success/Collision  \n• In both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 the “success” flag is false and there is no collision, so neither trajectory has reached the sponge nor hit an obstacle.  \n Step 2: Evaluate Progress (and Alignment with Expert Actions)  \n• For progress we consider how much closer the robot got to the sponge relative to its initial distance in the segment. Using the provided positions and the target sponge position, an approximate computation shows that Trajectory 1’s end‐position is about 0.12 m closer to the sponge than at its beginning (a reduction from ~4.37 m to ~4.24 m). In Trajectory 2 the improvement is very small (~0.02 m reduction from ~3.39 m to ~3.37 m).  \n• Regarding following expert actions, note that only Trajectory 2 has an “expert actions” list, and a quick step‐by‐step comparison reveals only a single match out of 10 actions.

As truncation is a lower‐priority factor than progress/expert similarity, this ranks third in the overall evaluation.  \n Overall Analysis  \n• Both trajectories are tied on success/collision.

{"full_text": "Step 1: Evaluate Task Completion and Safety\n• Both trajectories show no success (the robot did not reach the sponge) and no collisions. However, Trajectory 2 ends with a truncated step—which is discouraged because it usually indicates the robot either took too many steps or moved outside the allowed area. This “truncation” is a penalty even if no collision occurred.\n \nStep 2: Evaluate Progress\n• We need to consider how the relative distance to the sponge changes. Using the provided approximate starting positions versus the goal (sponge position ≈ [–0.109, 0.533]), we see that:\n – In Trajectory 1 the robot’s starting position is roughly [–0.307, 0.009] and its final position [–0.519, 0.009]. Relative to the sponge, the robot actually moved further away.\n – In Trajectory 2 the robot’s starting position is roughly [–1.077, 0.009] and its final position [–1.240, 0.009], again moving away from the sponge.\n While neither improved its absolute proximity, Trajectory 1 appears to have a smaller deviation penalty in progress.\n \nStep 3: Evaluate Expert Action Alignment\n• Trajectory 1 comes with expert action guidance. Although the actual actions taken (e.g. a series of turns and one forward move) do not closely follow the expert’s prescribed actions, at least there is an opportunity to compare. Trajectory 2 does not have accompanying expert actions, so we cannot assess its adherence.\n \nStep 4: Overall Comparison Considering Priorities\n• Priority 1 (goal and collision): Both failed to reach the goal and had no collisions. However, Trajectory 2 suffers by being truncated.\n• Priority 2 (progress and expert-action alignment): Neither trajectory showed clear progress toward the sponge (both appear to move further away) but Trajectory 1 is in a less adverse situation because it hasn’t been truncated, and at least there is some data to contrast with an expert’s plan.\n• Priority 3 (truncation): Trajectory 1 is not truncated while Trajectory 2 is truncated, which is undesirable.\n \nGiven that neither trajectory meets the goal, Trajectory 1 is marginally preferable due to the lack of truncation and slightly better (or less worse) progress.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]", "input_token_count": 2559, "output_token_count": 3890}

Check for termination outcomes (success or collision):  \n• Both Trajectory 1 and Trajectory 2 show no success (neither reached the sponge) and no collisions.  \n• Neither segment was truncated.  \n\nStep 2. Evaluate “progress” toward the sponge:  \n• For each segment we compare the initial and final distances to the target sponge position.  \n – In Trajectory 1 the Euclidean distance decreased from about 3.59 m to roughly 3.42 m (an improvement of roughly 0.17 m). Also notice that the x‐coordinate moved from –0.93 to –0.20 which is closer to the sponge’s x = –0.11.  \n – In Trajectory 2 the distance went from approximately 3.69 m to about 3.45 m (an improvement of roughly 0.24 m). However, while the total distance reduction is slightly larger, note that the x‐coordinate changed from –0.367 to –0.503 which actually moves farther away from the sponge’s x value.  \nThus, while Trajectory 2 shows a slightly larger drop in total distance, Trajectory 1’s motion is more “on‐track” with the needed correction in the x direction.  \n\nStep 3. Compare how the actions match the expert instructions:  \n• Trajectory 1’s actions (1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2) compared against Expert Actions 1 ([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]) have about 40% agreement in the early steps that overlap.  \n• Trajectory 2’s actions (0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1) compared to Expert Actions 2 ([2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]) only match in roughly 2 out of 10 steps (about 20% agreement).  \n\nStep 4.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Checking “success” and “collision”:  \n• Both trajectories have not ended the episode (none are marked successful, collided, or truncated). That means both are still in progress, so we cannot give immediate credit for a successful grasp in either trajectory.\n\nStep 2. Comparing progress:  \n• The goal (sponge) position is at approximately (–0.109, 0.533). In Trajectory 1, the initial robot position (using the first two coordinates of the observation) is around (–0.367, 0.009) and the final is (–0.503, 0.009). Calculating the Euclidean distances from the sponge at the start and end:  \n – Start distance ≈ sqrt((–0.367–(–0.109))² + (0.009–0.533)²) is roughly 0.58;  \n – End distance ≈ sqrt((–0.503–(–0.109))² + (0.009–0.533)²) is roughly 0.66.  \nThis implies that Trajectory 1 appears to have moved slightly away from the target.\n\n• In Trajectory 2, the initial position is (–0.930, 0.009) with a distance of roughly 0.97 from the sponge, while the final position is (–0.204, 0.009) with a distance of roughly 0.53. This clearly shows that the robot in Trajectory 2 has made significant progress towards the goal relative to its starting position.\n\nStep 3. Checking expert action similarity:  \n• In Trajectory 1, the robot’s 10 actions ([0, 2, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1]) are quite different from the expert’s corresponding 10 actions ([2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]).  \n• In Trajectory 2, the robot’s actions ([1, 1, 0, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2]) and the expert’s longer sequence ([0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0]) differ in places as well. However, since progress and alignment to expert actions are given equal weight once success/collision are ruled out, the significant forward progress in Trajectory 2 is a very strong indicator that its motion is following the intent of moving towards the sponge—even if the action sequences aren’t an exact match.\n\nStep 4. Evaluating truncation:  \n• Neither trajectory is truncated, so this priority does not distinguish between them.\n\nConclusion:  \nGiven that neither trajectory has achieved success or encountered collisions, the primary difference comes from progress. Trajectory 2 clearly makes better progress towards the sponge (improving distance from about 0.97 to 0.53), while Trajectory 1 slightly regresses. Although both show deviations from the expert’s action sequence, Trajectory 2’s progress is more robust.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]", "input_token_count": 2608, "output_token_count": 2227}

Looking at progress relative to the goal (sponge at [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]):\n • In Trajectory 1 the robot starts at about [–1.99, ~0.009, ~1.54] and ends at [–0.906, ~0.009, ~1.54].

Progress Toward the Sponge:\n• The robot’s start and end positions (its first and last observations) need to be compared relative to the sponge’s location.\n  – In Trajectory 1, the robot begins at about [–0.6863, 0.0097, 1.2853] and ends at approximately [–0.3921, 0.0088, 1.2749].
