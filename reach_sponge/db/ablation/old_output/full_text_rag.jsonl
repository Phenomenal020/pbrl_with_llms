Although the episode ended without success, there were no collisions and no truncation, which is preferable over crashing.\n\n• Trajectory 2 ran for 10 steps as well and never reported termination or success until the very last step. At that final step, a collision occurred. A collision is highly undesirable and detrimental compared to an episode that might simply finish (even if it is not successful).\n\nGiven the prioritized criteria (success > collision > good progress > following expert's actions > truncation), a collision is a very negative outcome. Even though neither trajectory reaches the intended goal (sponge grasp), Trajectory 1 avoids collision and therefore is better in terms of safety and potential recoverability toward the goal.\n\nStep 2: Based on these considerations, the answer is:\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]"}

{"full_text": "Step 1:\n• In Trajectory 1 the robot eventually collides (the last collision flag is 1), which is highly detrimental. Also, its observations show that the vertical (z) position remains very far from the target’s z coordinate (with final z ≈ –1.37 versus target's ≈2.23).\n• In Trajectory 2, although the “success” flag is still false, the episode ends (done becomes true) without any collision. Also, its z values are much closer to the target (the z starts around 2.28 and remains in the 2.2–2.48 range), suggesting that it has made significant progress toward matching the sponge’s height. In addition, there is no sign of a collision, which is a crucial priority.\n• Finally, even if the expert’s action sequences are provided to compare how well the robot followed good behaviours, the difference in collision safety and the substantial progress (in particular, the matching z coordinate in Trajectory 2) play a much more decisive role.\n\nStep 2:\nGiven that avoiding collision and showing good progress (especially in the vertical component closely matching the goal) is preferred, Trajectory 2 clearly avoids a catastrophic collision and overall better approaches the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]"}

Trajectory 2’s final pose is closer to the target sponge than Trajectory 1’s, even though its episode ended. In contrast, Trajectory 1 is still ongoing but appears to have made less progress toward reaching the target.\n\nTherefore, with the given priorities (and considering that no trajectory reached the goal but the progress metric now differentiates them), Trajectory 2 appears to be better achieving the goal.\n\n[Final_Answer: 2]"}

Looking deeper at the robot’s positions (assuming the first two numbers give the x–y location and using the sponge position of approximately [–0.109, 0.533] in x, y), we see that Trajectory 1’s final x–y (about [–1.16, 0.009]) is roughly 1.17 meters from the sponge target, while Trajectory 2’s final x–y (about [–0.202, 0.009]) is much closer (roughly 0.53 meters away).

(Trajectory 2 terminates, but not due to truncation.)\n\nStep 2. Evaluation Result:\nGiven that both trajectories do not achieve success and do not collide, the main distinguishing factor here is the progress – with Trajectory 1 ending closer (and seeming to be on better track) toward the desired sponge position.\n\nThus, the quality of the trajectory in terms of goal achievement is better in Trajectory 1.\n\n[Final_Answer: 1]"}

{"full_text": "Analysis:\n1. Neither trajectory reports a success (the “success” flags are all false), and both avoid collisions and truncation. That said, comparing progress is key. In Trajectory 1 the episode is still ongoing – the “done” flag remains false and the robot’s final reported position is further from the sponge’s target position. In contrast, Trajectory 2 ends the episode (the “terminated” flag becomes true), and the final reported position is closer in Euclidean distance to the sponge’s target (approximately 1.05 m away compared to roughly 1.39 m away for Trajectory 1). Although neither perfectly reached the goal, Trajectory 2 made better progress toward the target.\n2. Given that no collisions occurred and neither reached success, the quality difference comes from good progress – and Trajectory 2 clearly shows better progress.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Both trajectories fail to register a success (the success flags are all false), and neither show any collisions or truncation. However, when we examine progress toward the target—the sponge at position [–0.109, 0.533, 2.227]—we notice differences. In Trajectory 1 the position stays roughly around x ≈ 0.17–0.23 with little improvement toward the target, whereas Trajectory 2 shows a clear change in x from –2.00 to about –0.33. This change indicates that Trajectory 2 achieves significant progress toward closing the gap with the target. In addition, a brief look at the expert actions shows that, although neither trajectory perfectly mimics the expert policy, Trajectory 2’s early steps (with actions [1, 0, …]) align more closely with the expert’s first actions than Trajectory 1’s (which start [1, 2, …]). Given our priority order (success > collision > good progress > following expert’s actions > truncation), good progress is the most differentiating factor here, and Trajectory 2 clearly shows better progress even though neither trajectory achieved success.\n\nStep 2.

{"full_text": "Step 1. Both trajectories did not finish their episodes (none reached termination by success, nor did they collide or get truncated), so neither “achieved” the goal outright.

In contrast the goal is to the left at –0.109.\n\n• In Trajectory 2 the x–coordinate starts near zero and then quickly becomes negative (–0.20, –0.16, … ending around –0.28). Although there is some “overshoot,” this change in x shows that the robot in Trajectory 2 is at least moving in the correct left–ward direction toward the target’s x value.\n\nSince both trajectories avoid collisions and truncation and neither “succeeds,” the next important aspect is progress. Also, although neither action sequence closely follows the experts’ steps, the progress toward the correct spatial region is more important. In this sense Trajectory 2 shows a significant change in its state toward the expected region than Trajectory 1.\n\nStep 2.
